Homage:

Na mo guru!

Here, in the victorious expanse of the mother (yum),
the path traversed by all conquerors, the ultimate path of luminous words,
the condensed essence of the Great Perfection (rdzogs pa chen po)
Pith Instruction Series (man ngag sde),the secret heart essence
(gsang ba snying thig) transmitted by the great master Vimalamitra,
is the guidance (khrid) for fortunate individuals abiding in the lineage
of the ocean-like teachings. The method for engaging in the preliminary
practices (sngon ‘gro), the ornamented path of liberation, is as follows:

Setting and Preparation:

In a secluded place, sit on a comfortable cushion, adorned with a turquoise
bowl (yu bas pa bang thig), free from all obscurations (sgrib thams cad pa nga yi la pa).
With the profound meditative conduct (bsam gtan gyi spyod pa) for the
benefit of all sentient beings, abide in this practice.

Take refuge in the precious lama adorned with the five glories (dpal lnga), crowned
with a lotus seat (pad+ma’i gdang), and followed by the great vajra
holder (rdo rje ‘dzin pa cher po). Request: “Grant the accomplishments (dngos grub) of body, speech, and mind!”

Visualize the lama as Vajrasattva (rdo rje sems dpa’) seated on a lotus
and moon-disc cushion above your head. With intense devotion and fervent
longing (mos gus gdung shugs drag po), pray:

“O precious lama, essence of all buddhas, knower of all,
please ripen and liberate my mindstream with your blessings!”

As you pray, a stream of white nectar flows from the right toe of the lama,
entering your crown (tshangs bug). Your entire body is filled with great
bliss (bde ba chen po), and primordial wisdom (ye shes) is ignited. Finally,
the lama melts into light and dissolves into you, blessing your mindstream
(rgyud byin gyis brlabs). Rest in the non-grasping state of awareness (rig pa ‘dzin med).

1. Mind Training (blo sbyong):

Contemplate the impermanence of all conditioned phenomena ('dus byas thams cad mi rtag par),
generating renunciation (nges 'byung), compassion (snying rje), and
intense faith (dad pa gang drag). Engage in non-conceptual meditation
(rnam par mi rtog pa’i bsam gtan), entering the stage of accumulating
merit (tshogs bsag gi rim pa).

2. Taking Refuge (skyabs su ‘gro ba):

Visualize the central space transformed into a vast pure land (zhing khams chen po).
In the center is a wish-fulfilling tree (dpag bsam gyi ljon shing), its branches,
leaves, flowers, and fruits filling the expanse of space. On a lion throne with a
lotus and moon-disc seat sits your root lama in the form of Samantabhadra (kun tu bzang po),
surrounded by lineage lamas. In front, on the branches, is the glorious
Vajrasattva (dpal rdo rje sems dpa’) with the deities of the yidam mandala.
On the right, the Buddha Shakyamuni (ston pa thub pa’i dbang po), lord of the
three times, is surrounded by emanated buddhas. Behind, the Dharma, the supreme
jewel, is like a stacked rock mountain (brag ri brtsegs pa). On the left are the
Sangha of great and lesser vehicles (theg pa che chung gi dge 'dun). In the
intervening spaces are dakinis (mkha’ ‘gro), dharma protectors (chos skyong),
and wealth deities (nor lha), appearing like clouds.

With all sentient beings, body, speech, and mind united, take refuge with devotion:
“To the lama, yidam, and dakini hosts, to the buddhas, Dharma, and noble Sangha,
I and the six realms’ beings take refuge with devotion!”

Recite this hundreds or thousands of times as able. Visualize light rays emanating
from the refuge objects' hearts, purifying the negativities and obscurations
(sdig sgrib) of all beings, transporting them to pure lands. The refuge assembly
dissolves into the central lama, which then dissolves into you. Rest in the ultimate
refuge state (don gyi skyabs ‘gro’i ngang), the natural state of relaxation (ngal bso).

3. Generating Bodhicitta (sems bskyed):

Though ultimately pure from the beginning (gzod ma nas rnam par dag), due to
relative delusion (kun rdzob ‘khrul pa), sentient beings experience unimaginable
suffering. With the aspiration (smon pa) to establish all beings in the state of
perfect buddhahood and the commitment (‘jug pa) to practice the profound path,
generate bodhicitta:

“I and limitless sentient beings, inherently buddhas, awaken to this truth and
generate the supreme mind of enlightenment!”

Recite as desired. If distracted, use the breath to practice sending and taking (gtong len),
realizing the three spheres (‘khor gsum) as without inherent nature. Rest in the ultimate bodhicitta
state (don dam sems bskyed).

4. Vajrasattva Meditation and Recitation (rdorje sems dpa’i bsgom bzlas):

Visualize your ordinary body (tha mal) with a white lotus and moon-disc above your head (spyi gtsug).
From the syllable A, Vajrasattva appears, white, holding a vajra and bell, adorned with jewel ornaments,
seated in the lotus posture. At his heart is a white HUM surrounded by the hundred-syllable mantra.
A stream of white and red nectar flows from his body and mantra, entering your crown, filling your body,
purifying negativities and obscurations (sdig sgrib), transforming your body into a stainless crystal
sphere (shel gong).Recite the hundred-syllable mantra:

oṃ vajrasattva samaya manu pāla ya /
vajrasattva tve no pa /
tiṣṭha dṛḍho me bhava /
sutoṣyo me bhava /
supoṣyo me bhava /
anurakto me bhava /
sarva siddhiṃ me prayaccha /
sarva karma su ca me /
cittaṃ śreyaḥ kuru hūṃ /
ha ha ha ha hoḥ /
bhagavān sarva tathāgata /
vajra mā me muñca /
vajra bhava mahā samaya sattva āḥ

Recite as much as possible, and also:

oṃ vajrasattva hūṃ

Conclude with:

“O protector, due to my ignorance, I have transgressed and weakened my commitments.
Please protect me, supreme lord, holder of the vajra, embodiment of great compassion,
refuge of beings! I confess and purify all impairments of root and branch commitments,
all negativities, obscurations, and faults. Please purify them!”

Visualize purification, dissolution into you, and rest in the non-conceptual state (dmigs med kyi dang).

5. Mandala Offering (maṇḍala):

Before the clearly visualized refuge assembly, prepare a mandala offering:

Nirmanakaya Mandala: Arrange 37 heaps, envisioning the
Snow Lake pure land (gangs chen mtsho’i zhing khams),
complete with all riches. Offer:

“With this precious mandala, a cloud of delightful offerings,
endowed with infinite desirable qualities, may all beings abide in the pure land!”

Sambhogakaya Mandala: Arrange 9 or 7 heaps, envisioning the
Akanishtha pure land (‘og min stug po bkod pa),
adorned with infinite offering goddesses. Offer:

“With this Akanishtha, great bliss, jeweled palace,
filled with diverse offering clouds, may all beings
abide in the sambhogakaya pure land!”

Dharmakaya Mandala: Arrange 5 or 1 heap, envisioning the
clear-light dharmadhatu (chos kyi dbyings ‘od gsal ba),
adorned with the five wisdoms. Offer:

“With this naturally adorned clear-light pure land of the five wisdoms,
may all beings abide in Samantabhadra’s dharmakaya pure land!”

6. Guru Yoga (bla ma’i rnal ‘byor):

In the center of a vast pure land, visualize a space of five-colored wisdom
light (ye shes ‘od lnga’i klong). On a lion throne with a lotus and moon-disc
sits your root lama, inseparable from Samantabhadra (kun tu bzang po), blue,
clear, one-faced, two-armed, in meditative equipoise, adorned with silks and
jewels. Above are lineage lamas, surrounded by the three jewels, dakinis, and
protectors, manifesting as illusory wisdom forms (snang stong zung ‘jug ye shes
sgyu ma’i sku), an inexhaustible wheel of ornaments (mi zad rgyan gyi ‘khor lo).
They appear as needed for those to be tamed (gang ‘dul mos ngor cir yang ‘char).

Recite:

oṃ āḥ hūṃ

To the primordial protector Samantabhadra and consort, the four wrathful kings, the great blissful conqueror Vajradhara, I pray, bless my mindstream! Grant realization of the profound primordial purity and spontaneous presence now!
To the illusory wisdom Vajrasattva, mandala lord Padmanartesvara, and emanation Garab Dorje, I pray, bless my mindstream! Grant realization now!
To Manjushri, embodiment of wisdom, Shri Simha, supreme siddha, and Jnanakumara, I pray, bless my mindstream! Grant realization now!
To the great scholar Vimalamitra, self-arisen Padmasambhava, and great Dharma king Songtsen Gampo, I pray, bless my mindstream! Grant realization now!
To the samadhi-empowered Tingdzin Zangpo, Tharling Nangje, and clear-light siddha Sengé Wangchuk, I pray, bless my mindstream! Grant realization now!
To the unmoving conqueror Zhangtön, scripture-attaining Nyibum, and Dharma-spreading Guru Jober, I pray, bless my mindstream! Grant realization now!
To the delusion-dissolving Sengé Gyabpa, supreme siddha Melong, and great vidyadhara Kumaraja, I pray, bless my mindstream! Grant realization now!
To the clear-light Longchen Rabjam, great scholar Khyabdral Lhundrub, and supreme emanation Drakpa Özer, I pray, bless my mindstream! Grant realization now!
To the great delusion-dissolver Sangsang Dbonpo, lineage successor Zlaba Drakpa, and siddha lord Kunsang Dorje, I pray, bless my mindstream! Grant realization now!
To the essence lord Gyaltsen Palzang, prophesied conqueror Nyatshok Rangdrol, and liberation-teacher Tendzin Drakpa, I pray, bless my mindstream! Grant realization now!
To the omniscient Dosngak Tendzin, heroic lord Thrinlé Lhundrub, and treasure-lama of all lineages, I pray, bless my mindstream! Grant realization now!
To Vimala’s emanation Rinchen Namgyal, unchanging vision Mipham Paldrön, and omniscient Odiyana, I pray, bless my mindstream! Grant realization now!
To the unchanging vidyadhara Thrinlé Namgyal, primordial protector Thrinlé Chödrön, and root lama, true Vajradhara, I pray, bless my mindstream! Grant realization now!

“Free from hope and fear, dissolving samsara and nirvana into the dharmakaya,
realizing the spontaneous clear-light wisdom, perfecting the three bodies'
qualities without change, may I and others attain Samantabhadra’s liberation!”

With fervent devotion, pray to the root lama:

“O lama, vajra holder, sole friend of the three realms’ samsara,
refuge for beings without protection, great ladder to liberation,
lamp dispelling ignorance, I take refuge in you, lord of assemblies!
In the swamp of samsara, save me, the unprotected! Cool the burning
afflictions with the rain of your compassion! O precious buddha lama,
I have no other hope! From now until enlightenment, knowing my joys
and sorrows, look upon me, the unprotected, with compassion!
Clear diseases, spirits, obstacles, and hindrances!
Bless me with body, speech, and mind! Grant supreme and common accomplishments!”

Empowerment (dbang):

As you pray with intense devotion, the assembly of deities dissolves
into the lama’s body, whose majesty blazes even more brilliantly.
From the three places (gnas gsum)—crown, throat, and heart—white,
red, and blue lights blaze, marking the lama as the essence of all tathagatas'
three vajras (rdo rje gsum).

Pray:

“Bless all beings, including me, with the four empowerments,
ripening and liberating our mindstreams!”

From the lama’s crown, white light emanates, dissolving into your crown,
granting the vase empowerment (bum pa’i dbang), purifying physical obscurations,
empowering the generation stage (bskyed rim), and establishing the potential
for the nirmanakaya (sprul sku).

From the lama’s throat, red light emanates, dissolving into your throat,
granting the secret empowerment (gsang ba’i dbang), purifying speech obscurations,
empowering the channels and winds (rtsa rlung), and establishing the potential for the sambhogakaya (longs sku).
From the lama’s heart, blue light emanates, dissolving into your heart,
granting the wisdom empowerment (shes rab ye shes kyi dbang), purifying mental obscurations,
empowering bindu meditation (thig le), and establishing the potential for the dharmakaya (chos sku).
From the lama’s three places, white, red, and blue lights emanate,
dissolving into your three places, granting the fourth empowerment (dbang bzhi pa),
purifying subtle wisdom obscurations, empowering Great Perfection meditation (rdzogs pa chen po),
and establishing the potential for the svabhavikakaya (ngo bo nyid sku).

Again, pray to the lama, essence of all buddhas of the three times, as the four bodies (sku bzhi):

“Grant empowerment and blessings! Generate the profound path’s special realization
in my mindstream! Grant realization of the primordial purity’s view (ka dag gnas lugs kyi lta ba)!
Perfect the spontaneous four appearances’ wisdom (lhun grub snang bzhi’i ye shes)!”

With fervent devotion, the lama transforms into a five-colored light sphere,
dissolving into your crown (tshangs bug), merging the lama’s three vajras with
your three gates (sgo gsum), inseparably (dbyer med). Rest in the natural face
of innate awareness (gnyug ma’i rang zhal), beyond thought.

Conclusion:

Integrate this with the stages of cutting through (khregs chod) and leaping over (thod rgal),
engaging in the path as appropriate. Practicing this guru yoga as an ocean of accomplishments
(dngos grub rgya mtsho) is highly beneficial.  In all activities, with the natural purity of
virtue (rang bzhin dag pa’i dge ba), dedicate:

“May samsara and the lower realms be emptied, may no one abide in cyclic existence,
and may all swiftly attain buddhahood!”  Conclude with dedication and aspiration prayers,
entering the path of conduct (spyod lam). In all sessions, carry the three perceptions—appearance,
sound, and awareness (snang grags rig gsum)—as the lama’s three secrets (gsang ba gsum),
practicing the yoga of the two accumulations (tshogs gnyis).

Colophon:

This condensed recitation and visualization of the Vima Nyingtik mother and son
preliminary practices (sngon ‘gro), with faith, is intended to benefit those of
lesser intellect wishing to engage in this practice. In accordance with the
intentions of the great treasure-revealer lama Terchen Drakpa Gyaltsen and
his heirs, it was recorded in writing at the glorious Palpung Thubten Chökhor Ling
monastery in the snowy mountains by Jamyang Khyentse Wangpo, a wanderer of the kingdom.
May the virtue of this bring all beings swiftly to the youthful vase body (gzhon nu bum sku)
in the expanse of clear light (nang gsal dbyings).
