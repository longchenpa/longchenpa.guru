Nyela Rinpoche Rigdzin Changchub Dorje
(Nyag la rin po che rig 'dzin byang chub rdo rje, 1826 – 1961/1978)

This detail of a thanka shows the Great Master Nyela Rinpoche Rigdzin Changchub Dorje the way he looked like. Hpwever he wears a special blue robe with the face of a wrathful tutelary deity or Trowo ('khro bo) aka Tragthung (khrag thung) ore Blood Drinking Deity as for averting negativities. With his right hand raised like Guru Padmasmabhava he shows that the whole universe and its entire existences -animated as un-animated- are brought under his power and control; this is known as the aspect of NagziZilngön while with the left hand holding a magical dagger or phurba/phurbu (phur ba/kila/kilaya) he subdues and subjugates all powerful and noxious beings and spirits, etc. The peaceful aspect of the deity is depicted in the mirror or melong he wears at his chest. This seems to be the peaceful Vajrasattva or Dorje Sempa.
According to oral traditions, he attained the small rainbow body or jalü phochung ('ja' lus 'pho chung); the body shrank to a small size before the process was disturbed by Chinese guards who burnt the reminder of the body before the process could be completed..
He was a Great Master of Dzogchen, tertön and practitioner of Tibetan medicine. He was born in the Nyarong (nyag rong) region of East Tibet (Kham). Teachers of Nyala Rinpoche were Adzom Drugpa (1842-1924),[1] Nyala Pema Dündul (1816–1872), and Bön luminary Shardza Tashi Gyaltsen (1859-1934) (shar rdza bkra shis rgyal mtshan).[2]
Nyala Rinpoche organized and lead a community of Dzogchen practitioners in Nyalagar also known as Khamdogar (khams mdo sgar), Dedrol area,[3] Kham. In 1978 he is said to have attained rainbow body. If he was born in 1826 as is claimed, he would have lived to be far older than the oldest man ever documented.
