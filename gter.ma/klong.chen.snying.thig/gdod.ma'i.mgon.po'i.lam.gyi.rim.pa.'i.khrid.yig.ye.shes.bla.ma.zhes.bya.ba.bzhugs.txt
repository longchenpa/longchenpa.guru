From the Heart Essence of the Vast Expanse of the Great Perfection, A Practice Manual for the Stages of the Path of the Original Protector entitled Yeshe Lama

HOMAGE AND STATEMENT OF COMMITMENT

| [2] Homage to the Conqueror, the Teacher of Unchanging Light, (10)
| Whose intrinsic nature [3] is the inconceivable nature of phenom ena like the basic space of the sky,
| The original state where neither existence nor quiescence ever falls to any direction,
| Where every aspect is endowed with the supreme nature,
| The indivisibility of space and wisdom. [4]
| You are the epitome of the aspect of appearance:'
| Glorious Original Protector, 11 with consort and retinue,
| May you remain ever victorious within the lotus lake of my mind.

| The intrinsic nature is primordially unchanging, the object to be purified a temporary stain.
| Through the teacher who embodies the three .kayas, a rain of dharma [5] descends to completely cleanse [all stains]
| In accordance with the capabilities, faculties, and intentions of
| those who approach gradually and simultaneously.

| This is the sole chariot-superb spiritual path-of the Great
| Perfection which brings about simultaneous liberation. [6]
| Here, for a million ages, the most excellent merit has been amassed and fully dedicated by those who are life trees [of this tradition].
| By their glory, they appeared in the world as the incarnate scholars and translators of the past
| Who brought and upheld the undiminished victory banner of explanations in the Land of Snow Mountains. (13)
| O Lord of Speech, (14) life tree of the doctrine, may your feet adorn the crown of my head.

| The meaning of the ocean of tantra is so deeply profound and supremely vast,
| Except for the Omniscient One, with his natural wisdom capacity

| The presumptuous cannot hope to comprehend this.
| Nevertheless, Drimed Odzer has lifted the veil of obscurity to expose the meaning of all that is.
| Here, I will dearly synthesize whatever he revealed to fuUill the supplications of the fortunate disciples. [7]

Well then, even though the wisdom intent of the fully enlightened Buddha Kuntuzangpo never wavers from the space of phenomena,
through his wisdom mind he gives transmission to the five resultant buddhas not
other than himself. Having taught the profound and vast fully endowed
Secret Mantra" vajra vehicle and illuminating the three classes of tantra,
transmission, and upadcsha, the minds ofbeings-disciples to be tamed-
are naturally led to freedom. Here, without taking the generation and
completion stages into consideration, the nature of mindb is revealed as
the intrinsic nature of the primordial buddha, the fundamental nature•
of original purity.(4) [8] The view of lhun drub togal explains that everything is awakened as wisdom,
the nature of one's own appearances. These introductions arc explicated without rhetoric or analytical investigation;
rather, they serve as a direct introduction for encountering the nature of the mind.

As the path upon which the buddhas of the past embarked, that which
all future buddhas wUI achieve, and the sole pathway of all buddhas of
the present, this perfccdy sublime peak of all vehicles is untouched by the
intdJccrual tenets of the other cight. 17 Here, I intend to so dearly reveal the
natural great expanse of the wisdom intent of genuine truth, the original
buddha Kuntuzangpo, that it will seem to be spread across the palm of the
hand. [9] May the hosts of dharma-keeper c;lakinis grant pcnnission! 11
Herein lies the threefold tradition of giving oral instructions: the tra-
dition of giving instruction, of direcdy encountering, and of complete
entrustment to the traveler who is crossing over the mountain pass." [Ytsht
Lama] belongs to the first and, as the tradition of upadesha, it includes the
other two. This teaching will be given by means of three stages: for those
ofkeen faculty. who possess the force of the cause10 in order to arrive in the
absolute space of the original ground' in this lifetime; those of middling
faculty. who will be enlightened in the bardo; and those oflesser faculty,
who will take their next breath in a natural nirmir)akaya pure realm. [10]

FOR THOSE OF KEEN FACULTY

First, for the overview, there are two parts: the preliminaries and the actual teaching.

PRELIMINARY PRACTICES

For the preliminaries there are three ways to train: in order to discove~ 1
the three kayas, the way of training in the practice of the four elements;
in order to discover awareness, discerning sarpsara and enlightenmenr-u
with the three doors; and in order to discover the mind, training the body,
speech, and mind.

Training in the Practice of the Four Elements

First, of the six million four hundred thousand verses on the natural Great
Perfection,• in the extraordinary root tantra Rn~uberation ofSountf 13 it states:

| The stages of training in the three kayas emphasize the qualities
| of the elements. Diligently training in the sound of earth, water,
| fire, and wind will bring cenain accomplishment.

Thus, [11] although this quote expresses the value of practicing with the
four sounds [of the elements], since this is seldom practiced anymore, it is
acceptable to omit this.

Discerning Sarpsira and Enlightenment

Second, for discerning s:upsara and enlightenment, among both the outer
and inner, first the outer discernment is according to the Tantra of the Single Child of the Doctrine:

| Initially, begin with conduct in order to reverse the fixation of
| taking things as real through body, speech, and mind.

Thus, the way of acting is as the root tantra (24) states:

| Use the body to go, stay, twist, and perform various postures;
| stretching the extremities out and drawing them back in, per-
| form many types of activity. Engage mindfully in the conduct
| and forms of the beings of the six classes and [12] physically
| enact whatever comes to mind.

As stated, this will reverse the activities of the three doors that are gen-
erated through karmic habits, eventually bringing them to a halt. To avoid
the fault of the seventh downfall-namely, exposing secret conduct-one
must retreat to an isolated place where it is certain no passersby can observe
you. So that the local guardians of the environment will not become jealous
or disturbed while you engage in impulsive conduct, offer them a torma,
entreating them to enact miraculous activities. Now, in order to benefit all
sentient beings, think that you must engage in the practice of discerning
sarpsara and enlightenment with body, speech, and mind and that hereaf-
ter rebirth in existence will not occur! Give rise to this intention. [13] Then
strip down to the bare flesh and take upon yourself the extreme heat and
cold of the hells; the hunger and thirst of the deprived spirits;b the mis-
treatment and abuse of animals; the birth, old age, sickness, and death of
humans; the warfare of titans; and the exhaustion of merit and inevitable
plunge of the gods,< Make this a personal experience complete with the
physical drama of running here and there, jumping, twisting, and flinging
the extremities back and forth. In short, put to action whatever comes to
mind by following one's impulses without restriction or focus.

Likewise, the practice for discerning speech is as stated in the Reberberation of Sound:


| So as to eliminate the necessity to respond to whatever is said,
| express the various pleasing and displeasing utterances of dcvas,
| nagas, yalqhas, gandharvas, kumbhandas, and rahulas.• [14)
| In short, bring to mind and give expression to the dialects of the six classes.

Thus, as taught, make idle, senseless chatter and repeat the
sounds of various languages without the least concern for what should be accepted or rejected.
The activity of the mind is as stated in the Sole Heir ofthe Buddha:

| Cultivate a variety of mental states such as joy, displeasure, bliss,
| sorrow, permanence, impermanence, contemplation of the
| view, meditation, conduct, spirituality, worldliness, attachment,
| hatred, delusion, virtue, nonvirtuc, and so forth.

Thus, just as taught, forcefully invoking the proliferation of virtuous and
nonvirtuous recollections concerning the three times, [ 1 s] the three doors
will become quite weary, at which time one should rest and observe the
nature of the ensuing state that has severed prideful complacency. Like-
wise, it states in the Last Testammt:•

| One should also engage in the activity of the Three Jewels.

Thus, that means one should assume the vajra posture, with hands in the
earth-touching mudra. hnagine wearing the robes of ordination and that
light rays radiate from the hair coil between one's eyebrows. Engage in
peaceful conduct such as gazing out about the length of a yoke and so
forth. The activity of speech is to recite suuas such as the Heart Sutra
and others. Mentally analyze words as well as the tenets of the Prasailgika•
Madhyamaka philosophy.

Likewise assume wrathful postures [16] with the play of the nine char-
acteristics of dance. The activity of speech is to shout the sounds of rulu
rulu, hung hun~ phtt phtt, and so forth. Train in the ability of the body
and speech to adopt a variety of mannerisms. As the tantra states:

| Discuss various sounds of dharma such as mantras, prayers, phi-
| losophy, existence, nonexistence, and phenomena.

In this way, the discernment practices individually correspond to body,
speech, and mind. There arc also practices for alternating the preliminaries
ofbody, speech, and mind. Nevertheless, any characteristic of sa~psara and
enlightenment naturally arises as the manifestation of the three doors and
three kayas. To engage in these practices simultaneously is not only practi-
cal but extremely valuable. [17] Diligendy practicing this discernment for
half a month, eleven, or seven days in the short term will bring about the
natural reversal of fixation [that occurs] through the three doors and the
continuity of cyclic interdependence will cease. Ultimately, the body will
mature as dear light,b the speech will be purified as the chakra of syllables,
and the mind will be set free in awareness. It is taught that the benefits arc
boundless, and in bricfit states in the Rtalization ofEmpowtrmmt:'

| Whoever engages in the discernment [practices] will never
| return to the three realms!

So, it is.

Second, the inner divisions of practice [18] are according to the wisdom
intent of the Cltar Expaml tantra, which states:
At the crown, throat, heart, navel, secret place, and soles of the
feet abide the syllables ah, su, nri, tri, prt, and du.

Thus, once this habitual body exists, the seed syllables that bring about
the six classes of rebirth abide continually, along with the previow kar-
mic impressions. Since this becomes the circumstance perpetuating that
which follows, even at the moment of death, the subde wind-mind• will
gather wherever the syllables of the channels" abide and the [conscious-
ness] will be transferred to that state of rebirth. Therefore, during the pres-
ent time of the path, this extraordinary tradition of purification which
involves many easily applied methods is a special feature of this unsur-
passed vehicle. [19]

The manner of purification is as stated in the Last Testament:

| Because this body has arisen from the cause of ignorance: the
| seed syllables of the six classes endure. Because awareness is actually
| the three kayas, the three kayas arise as the three syllables. (25)
| Training with the syllables is the discernment.

Thus, as taught, the basis for the purification is the syllable of the gods, a
white ah located at the crown; the syllable of the titans, a yellow-greensu at
the throat; the syllable of humans, a pale blue nri at the heart; the syllable
of animals, a red-black tri at the navel; the syllable of the deprived spirits,
a dust-colored pre at the secret place; and the syllable of the hells, a smoke-
colored du at the soles of the feet. That which purifies is wisdom awareness
indivisible with all the buddhas [1.0] which is the intrinsic nature of the
three vajras appearing as a white om in the crown, a red ah in the throat,
and a blue hung in the heart. Clearly imagine these three syllables ablaze
with splendor. With the repetition of the sound of the three syllables, light
rays emerge to purify the seed syllables of the six classes including all hab-
its. Consider that everything is purified and nothing remains. Recite one
hundred tho wand repetitions ofom, ah, and hung for each of the seed syl-
lables of the six classes, along with additional accumulations to compen-
sate for shortcomings, bringing the total to seven hundred thousand. This
will bring about the signs of the purification of negativity, and ordinary
fixated attachment will be purified ofits own accord. In the Ckar Expans~
it states: [21]

| Whoever trains in the inner discernment
| Will eliminate the seeds that cause the confusion of samsara.

Thus, it is.

Training the Body, Speech, and Mind

Third, in order to discover the mind there are the three preliminaries to
train the three doors.

Training the Body

First is training the body. In the Reverberation ofSound it states:

| By the preliminary practice of the body,
| The causes of the individual functions cease.
| To assume the vajra posture and train with the body
| Benefits the mind.

There are two assertions explaining how to either stand or sit in the vajra
posture. First, join the heels of both feet, extend the knees outward, and
straighten the back. Join both palms and, while extending the elbows out,
[22] bring the hands over the crown withouttouching it. Tucking the chin
down to meet the Adam's apple, imagine the body to be a blazing blue vajra
with three prongs. When tiring of this, adopt the second unchanging vajra
posture. Holding the body so that it resembles a vajra, keep the torso erect,
arresting the all-pervasive winds. Joining the soles of the feet eliminates the
male, female, and neutral winds so that one can naturally abide within the
clear light of wisdom. Placing the two heels forcefully against the secret
place eliminates the basis of desire. By pressing the palms together above
the crown of the head, one trains in the key point of the body. Thus, these
are the assertions of the Omniscient One.

The way of implementing pure recollection is to consider that the three
upper points indicate the nature, intrinsic nature, and compassion, The
three lower points indicate the three kiyas, [23] and the central hub that
connects them indicates that the single nature of original purity and spon-
taneous prcscnccal6 is taken as the path.
There arc three reasons for this [stage of the practice]. In general, physi-
cal exhaustion purifies physical obstructions; and, in particular, imagining
that the body is a vajra ablaze with fire pacifies demonic and obstruct-
ing forces. Ultimately, attachment to the body will be reversed and the
vajrakaya established. At that time, the meaning of the interdependent
connection being aligned with the body so that realization arises in the
mind is that-by the circumstance of such exhausting activities-one sev-
ers the unceasing flow of concepts,& leaving naked awareness free of sup-
port. [24] This makes it easy to strike the vital point of encountering the
nature of mind.

Training the Speech

Second is training the speech. In the Reverbuation ofSound ic states:
Since speech abides as the syllable hung-through sealing, train-
ing, seeking flexibility, and entering the path-training the ...

Sealing

First, of these four categories, sealing is twofold: the outer scaling of
appearances and the inner sealing of the aggregates.

In an isolated place, assume the vajra posture and recite hung hung hung
hung. By reciting with a sustained melody, imagine that the entire universe
and inhabitants rum into hung. Just barely bringing your teeth and lips
together, without distraction mingle appearances, winds, and cognition as
one. [2.5] All appearances arise only as hung; and, if [appearances] become
insubstantial and uncertain, this indicates the sealing. The purpose for this
is that objective appearances will be naturally liberated.

Second, the inner scaling of the aggrcgatcs17 is that once again, by recit-
ing hung, all the outer bungs that emerged from one another now enter
one's body through the orifices of the sense organs. As they consume the
body, all internal organs-including flesh and blood-become purified
and nonconccptual. Maintaining the winds is a key point while considering
that the entire body becomes filled with bungs. [2.6] The purpose for this
is that the elements of the body will be purified and, without contamina-
tion, the corporeal form will be liberated.

Training

Second, training has two. First, by training with external appearances
through the circumstance of forcefully reciting hung hung, sharp, swifi:
blue-black bungs begin to shoot like bolts oflighming [which are] the size
of the objects that will be penetrated. Consider that all mountains and
houses which ordinarily appear solid are riddled with holes. The purpose
of this is to recognize that appearances lack true existence.

Second, training with the inner aggregates one imagines a blue-black
hung [2.7] the size of a hand span penetrating one's entire body, piercing
holes so that [it] is reduced to particles. Recite hung with tremendous
force. The sign of success is that the body muscles begin to quiver and,
similar to a reflection in a mirror, the experience of there being no true,
inherent existence arises. This pacifies illness and demonic-force posses-
sion of the inner aggregates and serves the purpose of liberating the body
in clear light.

Seeking Flexibility

Third, in seeking flexibility, one places a stick or other support in front
of onesel£ While reciting hung hung, imagine that an unceasing chain
of bungs rises up from the base of the support, gradually wrapping itself
around the stick all the way to the tip where the lead hung stands erect.
[2.8] Focusing one's attention there, slowly and melodiously chant hung.
When becoming tired, once again concentrate upon each hung dissolving
back into the other and finally gathering into one's heart. Relax. By repeat-
edly practicing in this way, all outer and inner concepts become the path
and the qualities of a flexible, exuberant mind are evidenced along with the
ability to control and transform any visualization.

Entering the Path

Fourth, for the practice: of entering the path, one visualizes oneself to be a
blue hung one cubit in size:, weaving along like a worm to many different
destinations. Starting with visible objects such as mountains and valleys,
imagine continuing to move slowly through many familiar places, [2.9]
like a tourist reaching the destination of a journey, while slowly reciting
hung in a manner that matches one's movement. The:: purpose is that,
through this cleansing of objective habits, the body and speech can be
rendered functional. Again, by reciting hung hung, one suddenly arrives
in the eastern pure realm of Manifest joy• or any realm of one's choicc::/1
like an arrow shot by an archer. This establishes an auspicious connection
for rebirth in the pure lands. In all cases wherever the mind is directed,
uniting and maintaining the wind, mind, and hung with single-pointed
concentration surpasses any other method for arresting concepts. [30]
Through this, the speech is purified of obstructions and liberated as the
sambhogakaya.

Training the Mind

Third, training the mind is as stated in the Revubuation ofSound:

| First, if the origin of the mind, the place of abiding, and the final
| destination are carefully analyzed, training in this way allows
| one to know the fundamental nature of the mind.

Thus, for training the mind, there is the actual mind training and the manner of resting in tranquility.

Actual Mind Training

First, there are three, beginning with an examination of the origin of the
mind and the origin of the apprchender.
If there is mind, from what direction does it originate? Does it stem
from the outer universe and its inhabitants, from existing outer and inner
appearances, or from the nonexistent state of emptiness and the like? [31]
If one claims that [the mind] originates from the standpoint of existence,
this falls to the direction of the philosophical tenets of the shravakas. One
should understand [the mind] by eradicating all fixation on the true exis-
tence of appearances into particles. Through such analysis, the origin of
the mind cannot be discovered, including reduction to a partless parti-
cle. Although one may recognize that [the mind] is naturally nonexis-
tent like a dream, if the arising of the unceasing, indifferent apprehending
mind-for example, the mind and mental activity-is not severed from
the root, then this is like the view of the Middle Way Mind Only SchooF'
of nonaffirming and affirming negation. Having fallen to rhe direction of
harboring expectations about rhe fundamental nature, one should [p.]
turn within to observe rhe mind of rhe apprehender! While doing so, if
one asserrs mat rhe mind mat momentarily remains in narural radiance•
or arises as various concepts is genuine, rhis is to base one's confidence on
rhe unsupported platirude of rhe mind.
Still lacking a direct realization of awareness, ifone claims mat rhe mind
originates from rhe perspective of emptiness, men rhe originator must cer-
tainly have shape, color, size, and characteristics. The intrinsic nature of
rhis must be analyzed. Through such analysis, me dualistic appearance of
a searcher and the sought become free from support or object. If left in a
state mat is nonconceptual and free of all words, expressions, rhoughrs,
[H] and theories, rhe meaning of rhe unborn dharmakaya- "baseless
from rhe root" - will be able to be internalized. In me Middle Way Con-
sequence' [siitra] it states:

| Since I have no definitive position, I am completely faultless

Thus, rhis is to arrive there. Even the way of arriving is not like rhe claims
of present-day philosophers who boast rhey hold rhis view [of rhe heart
essenced]. Unlike those intellectual exercises and analyses, through rhis
natural Great Perfection, one will arrive by beholding rhe nature of phe-
nomena.• This is what I have to say! (30)

Second, investigating rhe place of abiding and rhe abider is as follows.
If rhis present mind arises externally, it is rhe outer object. Ifit arises inter-
nally, [34] it is rhe inner body. By analyzing rhe place where it abides-
whether outside, inside, upper, lower, head, feet, or wherever-if the place
of abiding can be seen, rhen rhat shape, color, function, and so form must
also be investigated so mat rhis false, hollow cavern can collapse. When
one fails to observe anything externally or internally and directly analyzes
rhat which abides, that is merely rhe narural radiance of rhe consciousness
of rhe basis of allr arising as truly existing. This approaches rhe view of rhe
False Image Mind Only School.• Here, the mind has no cause or character-
istics, being more or less like writing on water which-even while occur-
ring-vanishes without a trace. Just like when a ship has sunk and the
[captain] frantically attempts to seize anything but there is only water-
at the moment of searching for the place of abiding, the searcher naturally
vanishes, [3s] thereby establishing the abider to be free from identification.
This internalizes the meaning of the unceasing sambhogakaya.

At the present moment, through the continuity of the feelings of the
three doors, wherever the experience ofcontact occurs, such as being poked
by a thorn, it seems as though existing right there. With the compounded
aggregates as the cause and the sudden onset of concepts as the contrib-
uting circumstance, the fixating mind attaches to the object of grasping,
resulting in the self as the possessor. When dualistic grasping is eliminated,
then at the time of arriving at the ground of the exhaustion of the nature of
phenomena, 31 the saying ·even if surrounded by a hundred messengers of
Avichi [hell] [36] there would be no anxiety or fear• is then understood.

Third, investigating the traveler and the destination is as follows. While
investigating the destination of the traveler-whether it be the outer and
inner universe and inhabitants, appearances, emptiness, existence, non-
existence, or something else, whatever the direction may be-by not dis-
covering any place to go, grasping with hope and fear for a result is then
reversed. If something is discovered, it is then necessary to determine the
details about the traveler such as any physical characteristics. If. during
this investigation, it is determined that there is nothing [that exists], one
will have the assurance of knowing that materializing phenomenabn can-
not result in enlightenment.

Since there is no destination, one will surely conclude that objective
appearances are fabricated by the mind. Since there is no traveler, one
will gain confidence in knowing that the subject is naturally nonexis-
tent. [37] It is then that empty awareness-devoid of coming or going-
is ascertained as the nirmat}akaya. This is the extraordinarily swifi path
because even the pith instructions on the collapse of the constructs of
the mind are included within the uncommon [instructions] on the ori-
gin, abiding, and destination. Through training in these preliminary
practices corresponding to the mind, on the mundane level negativ-
itics and obstructions arc purified and obstacles arc pacified. Fixation
is reversed: and, in particular, by means of distinguishing satpsara and
enlightenment, the characteristics of the mind arc liberated in the wis-
dom of empty awareness. Ultimately, one will become indivisible with
all the buddhas and arrive at the state of the original ground of vajra
mind. [38]

Manner of Resting in Tranquility

For the second, there arc two: resting in tranquility" and rcstoration.bn
First, in the Rtverberation ofSound it states:

| At this time, the key point for the practitioner
| Is to rest body, speech, and mind in tranquility.

Thus, through the exceptional activity of the preliminaries, some dis-
turbances of the physical constitution and clements arc produced. In
order to establish this as the innate nature of tranquility, the key point for
the body involves transcending good, bad, accepting, and rejecting. The
body is positioned as though it were a corpse in a charnel ground, and
the speech should remain in the nature free from expression. While train-
ing, one's breath should be slow and even. Like a cloudless sky, the mind
should remain free from the distraction of recollections and concepts. [39]
Practice this yoga, free of action or activity, and remain in tranquility for
twenty-one, seven, or three successive days. The reason for doing this is elu-
cidated in the Ckar Expanst tantra:

| Whoever is able to remain in tranquility will pacify the circum-
| stances that lead to imbalances of the elements and naturally
| liberate grasping.

Second, the practice of restoration is as it states in the Last Ttstammt:

| Restore through the gaze of the shravakas, bodhisattvas, and
| herukas. Gaining restoration through the three doors will
| encourage diligence in practice.

Thus, first, with the gaze of the shravakas, [40] assuming the seven-
point posture ofVairochana, remain without inhibiting the emergence of
perceivable concepts. Second, with the gaze of the bodhisattvas, allow the
eyes to gaze without any particular focus no farther than the length of a
yoke. Third, with the gaze of the herukas, part the legs in the advancing
posture [and], with aggressively darting eyes, stare into space. Shout aloud
ha ha, the fierce and haunting laugh of the hcrukas, and sing hi hi, the
female heruka song that is heard from afar. Train in this fearless conduct
that collapses the false, hollow cavern of appearances. The purpose of this
is as stated in the Clear Expanse:

| Through the peaceful gaze of the shravakas, the body, speech,
| and mind become tranquil. Through the gaze of the bodhisat-
| tvas, [ 41] tranquility becomes the nature of bliss. Through the
| gaze of the herukas, the three qualities of tranquility will also occur.

Thus, it is.

In the older texts, there arc some distinctions concerning the seven-
point posture in that the gaze of the eyes is said to be focused on the tip
of the nose, the gaze of the bodhisattvas is not necessarily peaceful, and so
forth. These presumptions are not well thought out.

ACTUAL TEACHING

Second, there are two ways of giving the actual teaching.

First, in order to sow the seeds of the four kayas as well as to render the
practitioner suitable for meditating on the swift path, by [the practition-
er's] entering the great maQc;lala of empowerment, all activities that bring
maturity are naturally acquired at this time. [42.] To give all the teachings
and then confer empowerment is not only illogical but an unpleasant spec-
tacle for those who understand the meaning of the tantras.

For the second, from the perspective of definition, this-the unsurpassed
vehicle ofthe vajra essence-takes the result as the path.That is why it is the
actual basis of all paths leading to buddhahood.The nature ofthe result also
encounters awareness. First of all, if we were to consider the ground with-
out its actual nature, it would be like seeing a temple but not the three sup-
ports in it. To think of profound and luminous empty appearances as mere
terms mat relate tO one anomer is simply insufficient for establishing trust
in the view and meditation. [43] Moreover, considering the actual nature
wimout me ground is similar to seeing the mrcc supports [in the temple]
but failing to establish their characteristics. Although having intellectually
understood mis through the four dogmas and by means of the eight lim-
itations free from elaboration,)! because mere is no inner experience, it is
unstable. To consider that this [rigpa] is not the ground or the actual nature
is like not seeing eimcr the temple or the statue of Shakyamuni within. 3 ~
The teachings state, '"Phenomena arc without inherent existence." Taking
that as a pam of mere mental speculation fails to directly encounter the
nature mat is wimout inherent existence. That is why [the Great Perfec-
tion] is not like a philosophy that ensures death will be ordinary.

Here the view of the heart essence of the natural Great Perfection
includes bom the actual nature and the ground. [44] Just like precisely
establishing me way the support and supported abide, one is able to
encounter a direct realization of natural liberation wimout depending on
imagining there is a view or meditation.

For the second, there are two divisions beginningwim the oral instruc-
tions on trekcho for those with keen faculties who, without meditation,
achieve liberation with total confidence.36 By meditating on togal, those
with great diligence will liberate the phenomena of the pam of the three
kayas and become enlightened without leaving a body behind.37

Oral Instructions on Trekcho

For the first, due to the distinction of faculties, there arc two ways of
encountering the nature.

Common Method

First, for the common, if a disciple of the heart essence possesses faith but
their mind is still obscured, [45] it is as stated in the Adorned by Direct
Introduction:

| Eh ma ho! Introducing appearances to be the mind, the mind
| gains proficiency. In turn, introducing the nature of mind to be
| empty. emptiness is sealed with bliss. Introducing emptiness to
| be awareness, the nature of awareness itself becomes indivisible
| with space-the dharmakaya nature just as it is.

Thus, similarly introducing appearances as fabrications of mind, holding
to true existence is reversed. In consequence, when the fabricating mind is
realized as empty, attachment to external appearances is purified.31 Intro-
ducing emptiness to be awareness prevents one from the nihilistic inter-
pretation of the nature of phenomena.
This way of teaching emphasizes these key points, but having understood
that, this does not even approach the direction of the wisdom intent [ 46]
of the heart essence as it is stated in the Naturally Arising (Awarentss):•

| The mind yoga of appearances means that everything origi-
| nates from my mind. If this mind is realized, what else is there
| to do? I have never said that those who keep saying this will be liberated.

So, it is taught.

In other texts, it is said that ultimately there is no mind. But continuing
to believe that the relative exists, there are those who will conceptualize the
view and meditation and practice that as the path. Likewise, even with the
dharma term ·unity; there is still a significant difference between the con-
struction of unity by bringing two things together and this dharma of the
Great Perfection-the originally pure, great, even perfection of awareness
and emptiness-where nothing is united. [ 4 7] It is for this reason that this
is a great, impartial distinction! Therefore, the Omniscient One said:

| It must be known that approaches which introduce appear-
| ances as mind and the mind's nature as empty arc not the wis-
| dom intent of upadeshas' heart-essence approach. While such
| approaches may be found in some upadeshas, it is in order to
| lead the lower to the higher but definitely not the definitive
| meaning.

As it is explained, the direct valid cognition that appearances are not the
mind is [proved] during [dreamless] sleep, unconsciousness, the two states
of union, and [the state of] perpetual lack of awareness. As it explains in
Discerning the Middle and Limits,• [48] during these five occasions of
being mindless, appearances have never gone anywhere. This is illustrated
by the experience of finding a jewel in a previous night's dream and the
experience of sexual pleasure; when one awakens from the joy and fixa-
tion upon its true existence, it is discovered that nothing remains. Because
of that, one can gain certainty that various appearances and recollections
arise from temporary circumstances.

These days, since the doctrine of the Great Perfection is declining, there
are many who trust only this method of direcdy encountering. Here, in
order to reveal the direct path, it is as stated in the NaturaUy Arising:

| When the lion roars with his own voice, all other creatures of the
| wild pass out from fear. When the Great Perfection uses its own
| language, all those of the lower vehicles lose consciousness.

Thus, as taught, [49] those who lack the fortune to consider cause and
result on the level of the doctrine of definitive truth and those who expect
results in the Great Perfection through mental analysis will verbally abuse
this system. However, the Omniscient One has said:

| It should be dearly understood that the assertion that appear-
| ances are the mind is the great darkness of perverted under-
| standing.

Thus, based on this advice, the reason for giving such an elaborate explana-
tion is in order to polish this path.

Uncommon Explanation

Second, the uncommon explanation for completely and direcdy introduc-
ing [the mind's nature] resembles the restoration of vision to a blind per-
son. Asking the disciples to assume the unchanging vajra posture, with
vajra and bell [the vajra master] melodiously chants the lineage supplica-
tion which transforms the ordinary mind. [so] After that, [the vajra mas-
ter says]:

Kyd Do not contrive or elaborate the awareness of this very
moment. Allow it to be just as it is. This is not established as
existing, not existing, or having a direction. It docs not dis-
cern between emptiness and appearances and docs not have
the characteristics of nihilism and ctcrnalism. Within this state
where nothing exists, it is unnecessary to exert effort through
view or meditation. The great primordial liberation is not like
being released from bondage. It is natural radiance uncontrivcd
by the intellect, wisdom unsullied by concepts. The nature of
phenomena, not tainted by the view and meditation, is even-
ness without placement and postevenness without premedita-
tion. It is clarity without characteristics and vastness not lost to
uniformity. [51] Although all sentient beings have never been
separate from their own indwelling wisdom even for an instant,
by failing to recognize this, it becomes like a natural Aow of
water solidifying into icc. With the inner grasping mind as the
root cause and outer objective clinging as the conuibuting cir-
cumstance, beings wander in s:upsara indefinitely. Now, with
the guru's oral insuuctions, at the moment of encountering
awareness-without any mental constructions-rest in the way
things truly arc, without wavering from or meditating on any-
thing. This fully reveals the core wisdom intent of the primor-
dial Buddha Kuntuzangpo. [52]

In the Sixfold Expanse" it states:

| The mind's nature, neither eternal nor nonexistent, is phenom-
| ena free of good or bad. This is called the wisdom intent free of
| accepting or rejecting: I, Kuntuzangpo, have revealed it. This
| nature of mind, devoid of accepting and rejecting, perceives
| things as naturally liberated without direction. It is called the
| great all-encompassing wisdom intent: I, Kuntuzangpo, have
| revealed it. This nature of mind, devoid oflethargy or elation,
| is the wisdom intent of great evenness. It is called the wisdom
| intent of the natural condition of the six groups: 39 I, Kuntu-
| zangpo, have revealed it. This nature of mind, which is fearless,
| perceives things free of expectation or disappointment. [53] It
| is called the wisdom intent that dwells in the confidence ofpri-
| mordial evenness: I, Kuntuzangpo, have revealed it.

Thus, and it also states in the Heap of Precious Jewels:

| This nature of phenomena without base, left as it is without
| being sought, is the greatest of marvels. This awareness, going
| and coming without ever meeting, is the greatest of marvels.
| This great wisdom that primordially abides, devoid of antidotes,
| is the greatest of marvels.

Thus, and in Tht All-Crtating Monarch it states:

| Even all the buddhas of the past did not search anywhere
| other than their own mind. Aside from what they already
| were, they made no adjustments. They never practiced concep-
| tual samadhi,' and they accomplished the nature of their own
| minds through that which is nonconeeptual. [54] Similarly,
| even the buddhas of the present and those to come in the future
| will achieve accomplishment only through the nonconceptual
| nature of evenness.

Thus, according to the tradition of this vehicle, the nature of the mind
is-from the very beginning-great natural liberation. Recognizing
that is called ·awareness." By maintaining this continuity, the state of
buddhahood will be direcdy realized, which is why this path is more expe-
ditious than any other. In this way, [practitioners] will gain inspiration.

In addition, [the instructions] on clarifying doubt and subduing hin-
drances are as follows. While maintaining the continuity of the great,
indwelling fundamental nature, if one thinks that the nature of this aware-
ness is empty. the one ascribing emptiness to this is the intellect, which
has a focal point. [55] The way that meditative concentrationd with a focal
point does not produce buddhahood is as stated in the Ptifected Skill of
the Lion• tantra:

| The meaning of the nature of phenomena cannot be seen
| through meditation with concentration. The samadhi of one's
| own appearancesb eludes the direction of concentration. Free
| from elaboration, the nature of phenomena is equal to the
| limits of space. All mental considerations arc devoid of con-
| ceptual fixation with objects. The dharmakaya buddha free
| from the four extremes, 40 such as existing or not, is one's own
| awareness.

Thus, this explains the method for purifying the encumbrance of holding
to emptiness as true into the nature of great freedom from limitation.

In addition, even though there may be the confidence of thinking "this
is how it is" to rest in the nature that is beyond the limitation of existence
or nonexistence and [56] to be bound to such a sense of assurance is a dense
veil obstructing one's own ground ofbeing. As the Great Garut!a' states:

| Any attempt to search for or discover a state free from dogma
| and limitation is like a blind bird searching for the end of space.
| Nothing can be found. The meaning that nothing can be found
| cannot be adjusted by anyone. It is impossible to find a limita-
| tion with awareness that is free of elaboration. ·

So, it is taught.

Likewise, once concepts occur-whether virtuous or non virtuous, form
or whatever arises as the objects of the six organs-there is no need to
intentionally fixate upon them. According to the vehicles of mental anal-
ysis, objective appearances are intentionally arrested merely through the
intellectual doctrines of nonaffirming and affirming emptiness and others.
[57] The way this fails to bring about enlightenment is as stated in The All-
Creating Monarch:

| Not knowing the all-creating monarch, the six sense organs per-
| ceive the appearance of the six objects. If perceived as suffer-
| ing, the sense organs thwart it. Not knowing the all-creating
| monarch, there is no result of freedom from origination and
| cessation.

Thus, it is.

Perhaps one may think that the lack of discerning between appearances
and perceived objects seems to approach the view of the relative True Image
Mind Only School.• For instance, in the first moment of seeing a moun-
tain, an ordinary individual is powerless not to think, "This is a mountain:
In the second moment, however, through investigation of the mountain's
intrinsic nature, [58] the strength of the mind and mental activity reach
maturity so the concept of"mountain• vanishes without a trace in its own
place. At that time, although the aspect of the appearance of the moun-
tain has not ceased, one is familiar with abiding in the nature of phenom-
ena without fixation on true existence. By purifying this as simultaneous
arising [of appearances] and [their] liberation, appearances and the mind
mingle. This is the unerring path of the natural Great Perfection.

The vidyadhara Garab Dorje said:

| At the time of arising, simultaneous arising is devoid of good or bad.
| At the time of liberating, simultaneous liberating is devoid of good or bad.

So, it is.

Therefore, without relying upon attempts to cleanse temporary obstruct-
ing stains by engaging in the difficulties of accepting or rejecting, this is
more sublime than the tainted discipline that binds one to the mental atti-
tude of considering what to guard and what will degenerate. [59] Here,
the sole vital essence of the wisdom intent of the king of the great vehi-
cle includes the path of the paramitas, all methods of conduct, and the
prajfia of samadhi-all of which are complete within the king of supreme
recollection, the nature of awareness. It states in the Sutra ofthe Special
Request:

| Without fixation is generosity; without abiding is discipline;
| unguarded is patience; without effort is diligence; without focus
| is concentration; without conceptualization is prajna.

Thus, with the support of scriptural quotations such as this, it appeals to
scholars and opens the eyes of the dull-minded. [60]

The way of directly engaging this nature of phenomena with the
four modes of placement is as explained in the Lamp That Illuminates
Appearances:

| Placement like a mountain is the extent of the view; placement
| of meditation like the ocean is the extent of meditation; place-
| ment of appearances is the extent of conduct; placement of
| awareness is the extent of the result. The practitioner possessing
| these four extents merges with the definitive meaning.

Thus, through placement of the view like a mountain one is introduced
to how things arc free of mental activity. The great self-radiance of aware-
ness is not subject to the effort of mental fixation or intentional mcdita-
tional antidotes. Place [awareness] in this total openness free of transition
or change.

Through placement of meditation like the ocean, [61] the body sits in
the lotus posture and the eyes gaze dirccdy into the vacuity of space with-
out creating a false trap of fixation on the perceptions of the six senses.
Abiding like the ocean unaffected by the movement of waves, the mind
is allowed to be lucid and pristine. Through placement in the upadesha
of conduct, allow the three doors to suddenly relax and sustain naked
cognizant wisdom that is exposed from the sheath of the view and medi-
tation. Through placement of the uncontrivcd result, by allowing the five
objects to remain natural, inner naked radiance actually dawns. As the five
winds41 become bound within basic space, even the dear-light purity of
one's own appearances will arise according to the common secret (42) in the
form of smoke, mirages, rainbows, and the like. [62]

In brief, since me innate nature is free from activity, me way in which
me three doors decisively settle within me expanse of spontaneous great
evenness is a significant key point of me natural Great Perfection estab-
lished through me twelve great modes of vajra laughter and me eight great
words mat purely define me eight groups of consciousness. This immedi-
ate awareness mat uanscends cause, result, accepting, or rejecting is taken
as me pam free from uansition or change throughout me three times.
Concerning mis, me great Lord of me FamUy, me omniscient Sover-
eign of Speech, 43 said mat all great practitioners who have arrived at this
nature [ 63] such as Padma,44 Vimalamitra, Tilopa, and so forth have openly
taught that mere is no cause, result, virtue, or nonvirtue. He also stated
mat, although mis may be realized intellectually, having not yet arrived
at that state through experience, we must take care to observe me subtle
workings of cause and result while not fearing me innate nature.
Thus, as taught by explaining how to discern me two uuths, those of
dull faculty will eventually come to understand this. The way this occurs
is, if those of dull intellect identify whatever passions arise and leave them
in their own place, in doing so the nature of the passion is rendered objec-
tively baseless from me root. [64] The wisdom intent where passions arc
rendered pure will then be maintained and me skill to do so improved. All
of those with superior faculties will know mat the characteristic of what-
ever passions and concepts arise will be unable to materialize through the
key point of me nature of phenomena being free in its own place. Just as
a knot in a horse's tail loosens of its own accord-since arising and liber-
ation awaken impartially, it is unnecessary to reapply any antidote. Here,
there is nothing to seal as wim me mind class and nothing to focus on in
the space of phenomena as wim the expanse class; through me upadesha
[class], mis is determined at the level of experience that rests free from
mental focus. When one is familiar wim this, it is as stated in The AU-Cre-
ating Monarch:

... unaltered, untrained, spontaneously perfect awareness.

Thus, as taught, [65] on the ground of uncultivated and unaccomplishcd
awareness-since everything is subsumed within the one nature of wis-
dom-mere is no need to intentionally practice the ten bodhisattva
grounds and paths through me effort-based generation and completion
stages of me outer and inner classes of mantra.

Meditation on Togal

Second, to explain the path of the great clear light of togal, there are two
divisions: the ways this is more sublime than trekcho and the actual excep-
tional path.

First, the great Omniscient One asserts that there arc seven ways [togal]
is more sublime. If presented here, through trekcho, there is no poten-
tial to purify the objects of confused perception such as mountains, boul-
ders, earth, and so forth. The difference is that. through togal, appearances
arise as five lights.' [66] That which is called ·awareness that is primordial
dear light" is determined through trekcho to be nonconccptual empti-
ness that is merely lucid. In togal by emphasizing the key points, the dif-
ference is that the wisdom avenue opens and the nature of phenomena is
witnessed through radiance. With trekcho, one searches for the clarity of
having abandoned the confused projections of the impure avenues of the
six sense organs. The difference is that, with togal, since the entranceway of
pure clear light is opened through the wisdom wind, the unimpeded sense
organs are able to utilize the appearance of the indivisibility of space and
wisdom as the four luminosities.

With trekcho, because one is dependent upon the coarse winds and
channels, deviations and hindrances breed. [67] Once that occurs, due to
the strength of the elements, there will be dependency upon age. Here
[with togal], since coarseness is the object to abandon, at the moment of
binding through the key point of the three states of motionlessness, one
takes the path of the genuine wisdom of winds and channels free from the
effort of fixating. Therefore, the difference is that the body is liberated as
dear light by exhausting all coarseness.

With trekcho, if the luminosities do not achieve their full extent, it is
still possible for liberation from the physical body to occur. However, even
though the body docs dissolve into particles, it is impossible to dissolve
into clear light. Without dissolution into clear light, the temporary kar-
mic body, [68] the contaminated sense constituents, and so forth cannot
reach the ultimate ground. One who is unable to attain the vajra body of
the great transference endowed with great waves of clairvoyance, the eye of
prajfia, and miraculous powers is incapable of accomplishing great waves
of benefit for the welfare of others. Observe the difference between the

Lord of All Victors, Padmasambhava, and the mahasiddhas of India and Tibet.

To summarize, even within Atiyoga-of the three classes of mind,
expanse, and upadesha-the mind class [emphasizes] the platitude of one's
own clarity while the expanse class relies on freedom from the ground.
Neither one direcdy realizes awareness. Even with the three [of the four]
cycles of the upadesha class, there is the expectation of liberation in the
bardo. Here, since there is the key point of liberation in the light body,
[69] the unconfused result will be discovered through the path of con-
fused perception. This difference will be understood by those who possess
eyes of prajfia.

For the second, there are four: the important points for toga! [prac-
tice], the path that reveals the actual key points, the signs that delineate the
stages of the four luminosities, and the supplementary upadeshas.

Important Pointsfor Togal

For the first, the key point of this king of all vehicles is to discern between
mind and wisdom. The intrinsic nature of the mind is the radiance of
the nature of phenomena; but, when united with the winds, [the mind]
becomes like a crippled person that has mounted a blind, unruly horse.
[70] In this way, [the mind] is not separate from discursive thoughts.
Concerning this, within the lungs is a channel that resembles a shaft
of wheat filled with wind and is the source for all breathing. From that
channel, by the strength of the expansion of individual networks of chan-
nels, there comes to be the objective appearances of the five organs which
assume the functionality of the passions and karma. It states in the Charnel Ground That Partakes of the Aggregattes tantra:

| Even though the nature of mind is wisdom, it appears as the
| manifestation of duality. With breath as the horse, circum-
| stances are encountered.

So, it is.

Wisdom abides within the "luminosity of the flesh heart", indicating
the nature, intrinsic nature, and compassion - these three-called the
•luminosity of the fundamental nature of the ground... It is similarly stated
in the Reverberation of Sound:

| In the celestial palace of the precious heart [71] is the aspect of
| the originally pure nature. This is the radiance of the embodi-
| ment of emptiness and clarity, appearing in the manner of a vase
| body with face and hands. Abiding as a spontaneowly present
| orb of light, each color of compassion is lucid.

Thus, being naturally nonexistent, it abides only as the ground for the aris-
ing of dear light. That is why in Entering the Middle Way" it also states:

| When the mind ceases, kayas manifest.

Thus, similarly the method for purifying the wind-mind is that in all
other vehicles up to the secret cycle-although relying upon the effort-
based paths of the generation and completion stages-discursive thoughts
and their functionality are merely rendered dormant. Failing to understand
even the key point of remaining inactive [7z.] and allowing the clements
to be pure in their own place, there is delusion concerning the methods
for taking the result as the path in dependence upon the key point of the
entranceways. That is why all activities of the body, speech, and mind-
virtuous and nonvirtuous alike-must be completely forsaken. Training
with the method of calming the wind-awareness is the crucial point. In the
Clear Expanse it states:

| All outer, inner, and secret activities are completely forsaken through body, speech, and mind.

Thius, it is. In this way, within a motionless state-adopting the manner
of a corpse in a charnel ground-the activities of the three doors arc for-
saken, and the way of recognizing the path of the arising of wisdom is as
follows. [73]

The channel connecting the heart to the eyes is a wisdom channel called
the hollow crystal kati.845 In the [Prtdous] Go/Jm Rosar/ it states:

| The channel that connects the jewel to the occan46 is white.
| smooth. and hollow within. Here. the great wisdom of the vital
| essence flows unsullied by blood.

Thus. as taught. the moment the body is initially conceived. there is a knot-
ted channel of procreation that exists through the ftmction of water. [At
the knot] two eyes come into existence: the eye ofluminosity and the eye
of the clements. From the eye of the clements. the body is produced. From
the eye of luminosity the light of wisdom is illuminated. In the center of
the pupils. there arc channels resembling the horn of an ox. subde at the
base and broad at the tip. [7 4] Along with that. there is a clear. radiant.
watcrlikc channel both white and dark called the •water luminosity of the
far-reaching lasso.""

To give more details. the Omniscient One has said:

| Through the pure light channel. the appearance of wisdom can
| be sustained. From that support. the perception of confusion
| occurs. Therefore. those with prajna will know that there arc
| these two aspects of the support and the supported.

Thus. this teaching is even referred to in the Heart Essence Tantrtf itself as follows:

| That which connects the heart to the eyes is the great
| naturally occurring." secret wisdom channel called the hollow crystalkati.

Thus. these wisdom perspectives are extremely compatible. [75)

That which naturally occurs indicates the clear-light channel not gen-
erated through root cause and contributing circumstances. Through this
interdependence, the way that the four luminosities arise, such as the
"luminosity of the empty vital cssencc,..-like the fan of a peacock-is as
stated in the Naturally Arising:

| The four luminosities arc as follows: the luminosity of the empty
| vital essence, of the space of awareness,b ofself-emergent prajna,
| and the water luminosity of the far-reaching lasso-all ofwhich
| abide within every living being.

So, it is.
The fact that even the subtlest support of the water luminosity of the
far-reaching lasso can perceive things as large as mountains, houses, and
the like is due to the subtle aspcctofthewinds. Ultimately, [76] by purify-
ing the four elements-including karmic winds-this matures as the four
luminosities due to the wisdom wind. By perfecting the strength of the
four visions, which are the support for (the luminosities], arriving at the
ground of exhaustion, the manner in which the pith decision occurs is as
stated in the (Treasury ofthe] Precious Gmuine Meaning:•

| First, it is necessary for the visions of togal to arise. It is then
| necessary to be without fixation during meditation. Finally, it
| is essential that everything becomes exhausted. Since awareness
| is combined with winds in order to achieve the immutable rest-
| ing place, it is necessary to purify the aspect of winds. With the
| increase of the aspect of the radiance of awareness, it is once
| again necessary that [the radiance of awareness] reach exhaus-
| tion in inner basic space. This wisdom intent is difficult to com-
| prehend. Due to the kindness of the guru, [ 77] atter a long time
| I was also able to realize this.

Thus, it is.

These exceptional appearances of the dear-light, natural Great Perfec-
tion are referred to in a hidden way in many of the great tantric treatises
such as the Magical Manifestation Matrix of Manjushri.d Even though
nothing exists within the nature of awareness, those completely blinded
by pride will-through mental imputation-claim that the origin of this
doctrine is based on delusion. Such claims arc utter stupidity.

Just as it is characteristic of the nature of the moon's waxing and waning
to naturally occur, likewise, within the nature of awareness, the character-
istics of the three: kayas originally occur. Therefore, once existing in this
way, [78] whUc: perfecting the proficiency of the sambhogakaya's quali-
ties as the appearances on the path, the vision of the direct realization
[of the actual nature of phenomena] up to the [vision of the] complete
extent is analogous to the waxing moon reaching maturity. The absolute
perfection of the exhaustion in the nature of phenomena as the innate
dharmakaya is analogous to the moon on the thirtieth day having van-
ished in space. (47)

Path That Reveals the Actual Key Points

For the second, there arc four: revealing the key point of the three doors,
observing clear light through the three key points, dirccdy encountering
awareness through the empowerment conferral of the energy of awareness,
and the supplementary, concluding summary.

Revealing the Key Point ofthe Three Doors

For the first, there arc three inner divisions. First, if one is unable to control
the key point of the body, there will be no ability to control the key point
of the channels. [79] If the channels arc not controlled, one will be unable
to control the key point of both winds and awareness. Without control,
clear light will not be fully evident; therefore, one must take care to apply
the key point of the body. As it states in the Garland ofPearls:•

| The three key points assumed for the body arc the posture of a
| lion, elephant, and sage.

Thus, these three will be taught beginning with the dharmakaya posture of
the lion. Assuming an air of greatness, crouch; and, by joining the soles of
bothfccttogcthcrin front, thcmobilitywindissupprcsscd.Bystraightening
the body, the winds arc able to 8ow freely. Allowing the weight of the head
to rest upon the neck is a powerful way to arrest concepts. Clenching the
fingers into fists [So] and placing them where both feet join together at the
soles balances the physical clements.

The Omniscient One said, "Some assert that placing the soles of the
feet on the ground and squatting with both palms touching the ground to
the right and left of the feet [is an alternative posture]. It seems that they
fatlcd to fully comprehend this wisdom intent." Thus, it is necessary to
analyze this.

The sambhogakaya posture that resembles a sleeping elephant is that, by
joining the knees to the chest, the blissful heat and clements are enriched
and vitalized. Placing both elbows on the ground equalizes the male,
female, and neutral winds. Using palms to support the chin arreSts the
coarse winds. Both feet pointing straight back with soles upward balances
feelings oflcthargy and agitation. [81]

The nirmanakaya posture that resembles that of a sage is that, by sit-
ting in a crouching position, the channels and winds arc balanced. Placing
the soles of the feet on the ground suppresses the water clement. Keeping
the backbone straight allows the wind-mind to flow as the nature of phe-
nomena. By joining the knees to the chest, heat and winds blaze as wis-
dom. Pulling the lower belly slightly into the spine severs the continuity of
thoughts. Linking the arms and covering the knees dispels imbalances of
the heat clement. In this posture, touching under the armpits dispels cold
diseases. Placing the two elbows upon the knees, clenching the fists, and
supporting the esophagus balance heat and cold. [ 82.]

In this way, for all of these postures, remaining relaxed without being
too tight or forceful is an important key point to avoid hindrances.

Furthermore, there are many postures such as the "fully awakened .. and
the ·unchanging vajra.'"b Nevertheless, since this is the wisdom intent of
those who arc considered the heirs of the tantra, for those who enjoy an
unelaborate approach the above-prescribed methods alone will suffice.

The specific qualities of these postures are as stated in the R~verbera
tion of Sound:

| With the dharmakaya lion posture, there is freedom from all
| fear of confusion, [83] allowing the ability to sec with the vajra
| eye. The sambhogakaya posture that relics upon the manner of
| a sleeping elephant utilizes the meaning of the nature of phe-
| nomena, allowing the ability to see with the lotus eye. The
| nirmir)akiya posture relies upon the manner of a crouching
| sage, [and] the nature of phenomena manifests as appearances,
| allowing the ability to see with the dharma eye.

Second, the key point of speech is as stated in the root tantra:

| Speech must rely upon training, enduring, and determining.

Thus, if silence is not maintained, in dependence [upon speech] con·
cepts, disturbances, disputes, [84] idle chatter, and so forth prolif-
erate. Since these four obstructions will occur, one must train in the
stages that reduce speech. Some individuals are extremely addicted to
the elaborations of speech. If so, first, they should go to an uninhabited
place. There, they should intentionally invoke and shout out whatever
their favorite subjects are some hundreds, thousands, and millions of
times. Once exhausted, they will lose interest in speaking, speech will
be reduced, and eventually they will even be inclined to give up the reci-
tation of dharma liturgy. [For one] content to remain like a mute, the
movement of the winds will slow down and then cease. As stated in the
Ckar Expanse [8s]:

| Those who penetrate the key point of speech in this way will
| exhaust verbal circumstances and be led beyond sorrow.

Third, the key points that correspond to the mind are as stated in the Clear Expanse:

| The mind is directed toward outer space while inner luminosity directly appears.

Thus, when the mind energized by winds-the essence of which is aware·
ness-is directed toward external space, the wind ofmobility becomes very
calm and the uncompounded, clear empty radiance of inner luminosity
clearly dawns as the union of space and awareness. It is similarly stated in
the Ckar Expanse:

| By penetrating the key points of the mind in this way, awareness
| of the three kayas will appear as emptiness. [ 86]

Observing Clear Light through the three key points

Second, observing clear light through the three key points is as stated in
the Reverberation of Sound:

| One must rely upon the key points of the entranceway, object,
| winds, and awareness.

[The key points] are delineated here by commas, whereas other texts refer
to them as actual terms. Therefore, four [rather than three] key points are
optional.

When the three key points originate as terms, they are as follows:

| When winds and awareness are relaxed, wisdom will be achieved.

Thus, from the perspective of the single function of [winds and aware-
ness], this is explained as three [entranceway, object, and winds and aware-
ness as one]. This way of categorizing is not contradictory. In addition,
there are other ways to establish this.

Concerning that, first there is the key point of the entranceway for aris-
ing as stated in the root tantra: [ 87]

| The key point of the entranceway is to gaze upward, downward, and sideways.

Thus, since the dharmakaya possesses the eye of the nature of phenomena,
the manner of gazing is upward toward the crown of the head. 41 This is a
key point for the downward dispelling of habits. Since the sambhogakaya
possesses the eye of wisdom, the manner of gazing is direcdyoutward. This
is a key point for mingling sarpsara and enlightenment as one taste. Since
the nirmiJ)akaya has the eye ofprajna, the manner of gazing is downward.
This is a key point for direcdy ascertaining the appearance of wisdom.

The key point of the entranceway does not end here. If one were to
encounter the inner meaning, it states in the Garland [of Pearls]:

| Appearing from the crown aperture of exaltation, the unceasing
| chain of awareness is nonconcc:ptual. [88]

Thus, indicated by the entranceway for the wisdom of transference, the
radiance of the nature of emptiness arises from the: central channel of light.
From within the channel of the: lungs, the radiant awareness of compas-
sion arises. Based on these descriptions, it states in the Sun, Moon, Plan-
ets, and Stars:

| Recognizing the two ordinary channels of the eyes as the path is
| a limitation, indicating a lack of understanding.

Thus, it is taught. Although this point is made, at the present time of prac-
tice, two gateways are sufficient. As it states:

| With eyes halfopen, look at the: sun. [Appearances will be] lucid
| like constellations in the cast

So, the key point is, with eyes half open, direct the gaze to a distance one
cubit away from the: sun. [ 89] The sign that the key point of the entrance-
way has been accomplished will be that one: is able to gaze at the object
indefinitely.

Second, the: key point of the object, which is the basis for the arising,
is that in a place free: from nonconducivc circumstances-lofty, dear, and
open-in late summer and fall before the harshness of winter, as well as
in the springtime, a beginner should practice by gazing at the two rays 4'
in pure space: completely devoid of circumstances such as clouds or wind.
Once the space-awareness separates from the point between the: eyebrows,
with a very relaxed face one should turn to the west in the early morning or
east in the late aficrnoon.w Free: from the: circumstance of the sense organs,
one rests in the water luminosity of the far-reaching lasso. [90] As it states
in the: Clear Expanse:

| There will be lucidity when there: is freedom from three: circumstances (58)
| The meaning to be known here is to examine the purity of the sky.

Thus, that is why this is taught.

For the third, there are two. First, the key point of the winds is that wind
is mobile so, when concepts ride this as their mount, even the essence of
the sugatas~ 2 can be lured. Therefore, the method for averting the cause of
that is the heart-essence tradition of breathing through the mouth rather
than the nostrils. Exhaling and inhaling very slowly and calmly, with lips
and teeth almost touching, is a special feature of this tradition. [91] The
difference is that, in all the upadeshas which specify wind be inhaled
through the nostrils, the wind is the object to be purified within the four
chakras. By the force of that [wind], it is easy for obstructions and faults to
occur. Here, [by bringing the wind in through the mouth], the wind that
circulates through the lungs is purified by relaxing in its place; and radi-
ance dissolves into the heart. Conceptual wind as the object to be cleansed
is purified in its place without rejection. The individual qualities of each
chakra are spontaneously present without being sought. That is a key point
for liberating wisdom wind in clear light. Maintaining long, extended
breaths without force is mentioned in the Ckar Expanse:

| When gently equalizing the Aow of the breath, breathing
| becomes slight [92.] and the coming and going of the breath
| will cease.

This is a crucial key point for rendering space-awareness motionless.
Second, the key point of awareness is that, by engaging in the modes
of gazing and the postures just explained as well as practicing according
to the three key points of the entranceway, object, and winds, one leaves
aside all responsibilities and maintains a state of complete inactivity. The
indication that existence has been perfectly liberated is that, by focusing
on the vast openness of the clear expanse of outer space, it will seem as
though awareness is dissolving. Then, an orb of very pure and radiant blue
light will initially arise. From that, the way that appearances emerge is as·
five radiant lights [93] of five colors resembling an unfurled bolt of bro-
cade cloth. This is referred to as ·inner space appearing outwardly: In the
tantras it states:

| Space is both outward and inward. Outwardly, it is like a cloud-
| less sky; while inwardly it is luminous.

Thus, it is. Because I never noticed that any [scholar-practitioners] of the
past had comprehended the meaning of this key point about outer and
inner space, I am compelled to include this quote from the guru who is
the original buddha:

| Some people identify this only as a cloudless outer sky. That per-
| spective is extremely unacceptable. The reason is that there is no
| connection between the sky and the individual [94] Whether
| there isluminosityor not depends on the individual. Here, inner
| space is the blue radiance that arises externally, called •me outer
| space: Therefore, the sky is merely the avenue for the appear-
| ance of the ground [perfectly pure space] and is not the actual
| space. Actual space is blue, and that is the inner space. In this
| way, space and the visions that arise from that are called both
| outer space and inner space. Although referred to separately, it
| should be understood to be like a tent of dull rainbow light that
| becomes increasingly more lucid. This is not like retracting the
| inner or projecting the outer. One arises from the other. Outer
| and inner appearances must be understood in this way.

So, it is.

Therefore, by understanding this, within the luminosity of pure space,
[95] that which arises as the purification of karmic wind is the luminos-
ity of the empty vital essence. Just as when a stone drops into a well of
water and circular ripples appear, rings of molecules as five-colored light
and so forth become evident. By emphasizing that with the far-reaching
gaze, extremely radiant inner awareness is experienced without material-
izing. This is the nature of the luminosity of self-emergent prajiia; and,
from that, there is the arising of sharp and rapid prajiia that comprehends
objects as well as the natural ability to know the meaning of words. This is
the energy of prajna.

Then, the awareness of true seeing" appears as the vajra chain of aware-
ness~> like a string of fine pearls or a floating golden thread. [96] This is
called the "radiance of prajna." It is necessary to recognize that, although
there is a single nature, it is distinguished in three ways. If that distinction
is not made, then it is as the Omniscient One said:

| Some say that cognition is the: prajfla luminosity that naturally
| occurs. Some say it is inner radiance. Still others call this the
| "chain of awareness." Therefore, they are confused.

Thus, it is taught. The radiance of awareness as the vajra chain that is seen
in this way shoul be positioned within the enclosure of space and the vital
essence. This meditation is a key point of awareness. In the Ckar Expans~
it states:

| The key point of awareness is to hold the vajra chain. This should
| be practiced by those whose appearances arc: rdaxed.

Thus, it is. [97]

During this time, if one falls prey to even a hair's worth of analysis
concerning the: appearance of light, then the vajra-chain awareness will
become: materialized, binding one to hindrances and pitfalls. The visions
of the luminosities arc one's own nature of phenomena itself rendered evi-
dent, so one must train in fearless conduct" without fixation. Until famil-
iar, the appearances will move like a mirage, buoyant and shimmering.
If one takes care to gradually guide this through the way of gazing, then
by achieving familiarity, however much the inner nature of the channels
vanishes into light will be how much space-awareness separates from the
point between the eyebrows. The circumstance of depending upon exter-
nal objects will decrease, thus allowing the experience of the four visions
to gradually increase. [98]

Subsequently, since this is to see through the ordinary eye, it is neces-
sary to reach the ground of exhaustion. If this is seen through the eye of
prajna, simultaneous exhaustion will occur without the certainty of grad-
ual stages. This is due to the inconceivable differences among individu-
als. However, in both cases, even for someone whose channel of ignorance
is superior, the manner of arising will still be unpredictable. That is why
one should not assume this is a sign of [perfecting] this path. Based on
the sole root cause and contributing circumstance of heat and moisture, a
seed can prematurely ripen yet become impotent. Therefore, it is crucial
to know one's level only through [consulting] the upadesha of the final
result. [99]

Directly Encountering Awareness

For the third, there are two: entering the great wisdom maJ)<;{ala of one's
own appearances and conferral of the energy of awareness empowerment'
to encounter the innate nature.
First, in a fully endowed place and time, on a mountain peak or in an
extremely remote area where it is natural for the visions"to directly emerge,
offer a ganachakrab and torma as well as a golden maJ)<;{ala to the guru and
repeat the following supplication:

| Guru, great holder of the vajra, so that I may be liberated from
| samsara, please bestow the empowerment of the energy of awareness,
| the great secret path ofVajrasattva.

After three repetitions, [100] the guru and all disciples remove their upper
garments, symbolizing that the appearance of clear light is free from the
veil of obscurity. Then, the guru gives the indication saying, ·without
blinking, gaze upon the blue syllable ahs 3 in my heart and rest your mind
without distraction!" The vajra master plays the hand drum; and, after the
descent of blessings, suddenly the master shouts the sound of phet with
great intensity and at that very instant slowly inquires three times, •What
is the mind?" When the disciples are speechless and without focus, left in
a state of shock, that sudden apparent uncontrived awareness is known as
the great seeing of that which was previously unseen; [101] which is also
called the •descent of wisdom while resting in the dharmakaya".

The actual entrance is as follows. All disciples arc asked to assume the
posture of the sage and, as they gaze into space without focus, to bring the
natural pure realm to mind. Then, the guru says,

| Eh ma hoi Listen, my heart children of great fortune! In the
| eastern direction is the extremely pleasing, magnificent pure
| land called Manifest Joy, where the conqueror Vajra Alqhobhya
| abides. He is blue and adorned with various jeweled ornaments.
| In the southern direction is the extremely pleasing, magnificent
| pure land [102.] called Endowed with Glory, where the con-
| queror Ratnasambhava abides. He is yellow, adorned with vari-
| o us jeweled ornaments. In the western direction is the extremely
| pleasing, magnificent pure land calJcd Lotus Arrangement,
| where the conqueror Amitabha abides. He is red, adorned
| with various jeweled ornaments. In the northern direction of
| the extremely pleasing, magnificent pure land called Pcrfecdy
| Complete Activity dwells the conqueror Amoghasiddhi, green,
| adorned with various jeweled ornaments. All of them abide in
| indivisible union with their consorts. [103] With assemblies as
| numerous as the immeasurable buddhas that exist upon a single
| particle, all of them are listening to their individual teachers as
| each reveals to his respective assembly the dear-light nature of
| mind and the nature of Secret Mantra just as it is. 0 sons and
| | daughters, with the gaze of an elephant, look into the eastern
| direction. Like a leaping lion, jump! With the gaze of a lion,
| look into the southern direction. Like a bounding tigress, lunge!
| With the wrathful, haughty gaze of the heruka, [104] look into
| the western direction. Fly there like a soaring garu4al With the
| gaze of Vajradhara, look into the northern pure land. Depart
| like the flash of a lightning bolt! ah ah ah

So, this is irreversibly scaled.

In this way-having been led into the four entranceways of the maQ4ala
of awareness-when a disciple with pure faith connects with a highly real-
ized vajra master, even if the disciple fails to practice in that lifetime, he or
she will be free to take rebirth in a natural nirmit;lakaya pure realm. That is
the exceptional feature of this Secret Mantra.

Entering the dharmakaya of the sambhogakaya is as follows. The disciples
arc asked to assume the vajra posture, gaze straight out into space, [Ios]
and bring the pure land of Rich Array to mind. The guru says,

| Eh ma! All fortunate children of the mind, listen! That which
| completely transcends all of this is the natural nirmar;takaya pure
| realm-the basis of the arising of everything without exception.
| Like observing one's own face [in a mirror], the pure realm of
| Rich Array is absolutely radiant, enveloped by the five aspects
| of wisdom. Completely even and motionless, it is here where
| the Bhagavan, Foe Destroyer, Exhauster of the Contaminants,
| One Gone to Bliss, Omniscient in the World, Transformer of
| Disciples to Be Tamed, Unsurpassed, [1o6] Guide of All Gods
| and Humans, the Perfecdy Enlightened One known as Buddha
| Amirabha resides. He is surrounded by a boundless assembly
| of hundreds, thousands, and millions of perfccdy enlightened
| buddhas and delights in the extremely pure manifestation of the
| nature of phenomena. 0 children, with the gaze of an elephant,
| look! Depart with the leap of a lion! ah ah ah

So, this is irreversibly scaled by [the view of] emptiness.

Entering the dharmakaya madala is as follows. The disciples arc asked
to assume the lion posture. To establish the auspicious connection for
obtaining the five sublime eyes of those on the ground of buddha.~ they
gaze upward, [107] downward, to the right, left, and directly ahead. To
introduce the wisdom of naked, empty awareness, the guru says,

| Eh ma! Fortunate heart children of the mind, listen! That
| which transcends and is far beyond the two riipakayas•ss is the
| basis from which both of them arise, the nature of one's own
| awareness,& free from mental considerations as wisdom that is
| absorbed yet unobscurcd.S' This nature of phenomena that has
| no distinctions whatsoever is immeasurable, boundless, and
| nonconccprual. Disciples, in this innate nature free from des-
| tination, check to determine who is the traveler and then rest.
| By understanding empty awareness, hold fast to the key point!
| [108] Without any hindrance, train! With clear wisdom, train
| on the path! With manifold phenomena, do not fixate! Within
| the inconceivable .•• ah ah.

So, the guru speaks.

When one receives empowerment in this maQcjala, ignorance is cleansed
in the ground, awareness increases as wisdom, and one is empowered to
actually meditate. Through this, even those with weak famUiarity will be
liberated in the bardo. The most supreme wUI be liberated in this very
lifetime.

For the second. all disciples arc asked to carcfuUy assume the postures of
the three doors and the ways of gazing. [109] In order to indicate the key
points of the greatness of clear-light togal. the guru says.

| Kye! Fortunate children of the mind, listen! In the innate secret
| ofthe precious heart dwells the seed of the wisdom vital essence.
| From the perspective of the nature, this is empty and sclftcss;
| and, from the perspective of the intrinsic nature, this is unceas-
| ingly radiant. From the compassionate manifestation, insepa-
| rable kayas and wisdom arc aii-Uiuminating like a lamp within
| a vase. The four luminosities arc naturally clear as they emerge
| from the precious crystal channel of radiant light. Through this,
| dirccdy encountering the nature ofphenomena ofthe unceasing
| ornamental wheel of the enlightened body. speech, and mind
| of all sugatas; you have received the great empowerment of the
| energy of awareness. [110]

How docs this occur? The clear light of wisdom-awareness is Buddha Vai-
rochana. That unchanging nature is Buddha Ak~hobhya. The ever-increas-
ing dear-light radiance is Buddha Ratnasambhava. The immeasurable
appearance of light is Buddha Amitabha. Being perfect and unsought in
itself is Buddha Amoghasiddhi. In this way, the faces of all five buddhas
arc dirccdy realized.

Even the nature of this wisdom appearing as stainless awareness is the
mirror. 57 As the nonduality of clear light and the nature. this is the (wis-
dom of] evenness. As the arising of distinct details, this is discerning wis-
dom. Being spontaneowly present and unsought is all-accomplishing
activity [wisdom]. [111] Primordially empty and baseless is the basic space
of phenomena. This is the nature of the five aspects of wisdom.

The essence [that is] unchanging is thevajra.~lhcqualities fully endowed
are ratna. Appearances untainted by any stain are padma. That there is no
other accomplishment aside from this is the karma family. Because all of
this is the: path that all buddhas have traversed, it is the buddha family.
Because clear light is stainless, it is whitc.s9 Because qualities arc per-
fected, it is yellow. Abiding without being sought is red. As the: perfected
skill of activity, it is green. As unchanging and firm, it is blue.

The way [awareness] abides as the five: winds is as foUows. [112] That these
visions of clear light have: never been separate from the warmth of wisdom
is the heat-assimilating wind. 60 That the life of sarpsara and enlightenment
is maintained is the life-sustaining wind. That the discernment is made
between the pure and poUutc:d aspects of s:upsara and enlightenment is
the pure- and impure-distinguishing wind. That awareness pervades every-
thing is the: all-pervasive wind. That the life: ofsal}lsara is severed and one is
led beyond sorrow is the merciless karmic wind of the kalpa.

The way this abides as the five states of prajiia is as foUows. Based on
realizing the nature of clear light or not, by discerning between sarpsara
and enlightenment, there: is the prajfia of discerning. Through the: vision of
the increasing manifestation and so forth, the appearances of the: energy of
wisdom are gathered as the: prajfia of gathering. [113] By pervading every-
thing, there is all-pervasive prajfia. Through the: motion of the visions of
light going and coming, there is the: prajfia of movement. If this is realized,
to be liberated from sarJlsara is the prajfia of liberation. These are the six
groups of five:.

Furthermore, since the blue: light is understood to be Buddha J:)akini,
by including the other four aspects of awareness, one sees the faces of the:
five 9akini purifiers of the objects to be cleansed. All these categories of
seven groups of five are the inherent nature: of awareness as the path.

The: way of establishing resultant appearances as ultimate perfection is
also stated in the Clear Expanse:

| From the: self-manifestation of naturally occurring awareness, 
| the five kayas and five aspects ofwisdom, five families, five lights,
| [114] five winds, five prajfias, and so forth abide.

In brief. this indwelling nature of phenomena is not the designing intel-
lect of the mental experience of empty form that is analytically designated
nor docs it originate from interdependency based on fixating with effort
in practices involving the channels and winds. The originally established
experience of the visions that directly realize the undeniable nature of
phenomena renders evident the phenomena of the path and result begin-
ning with perfecting refuge in the Three Jewels according to the teachings
of Buddha up to the ten topics of the ocean of tantric classifications.61 The
way this occurs is as stated in the Sixfold Expanse: [us]

| The primordially perfect buddha, dharma, and sangha abide as
| one's own body.

Thus, the unconfused nature of the mind is the ground of buddhahood,
uanscending sounds and words is the genuine dharma, and freedom from
vacillation is the essence of sangha. This is unlike those who take refuge
momentarily through interest, anger, or delusion.

Never separate from the vajra refuge of the fundamental nature, within
that one engages in the clear light of the four visions. This way of engaging
is as stated in the Lamp That Illuminates Appearances:

| Primordially, this is the way of arising. Without originating
| through the efforts of individuals, [u6] this is the maJ)qala as
| well as the deity; this is mantra, mudra, and offering; this is the
| generation and completion stages; the buddha, sentient beings,
| satpSara, and enlightenment; empowerment, vows, and samaya;
| this is one's guru as well as the deity.

Thus, it is.

Therefore, one should never be apart from the appearance of the vajra
chain of awareness in the center of the vital essence ofbasic space. As stated
in the Arrangement ofColorfuljewels:•

| If you wish to sec the mind of all buddhas, gaze at the kaya of
| the vajra chain of awareness. If you wish to internalize the wis-
| dom intent of all buddhas, never be separate from the vajra
| chain of awareness. If you wish to fully comprehend all aspects
| of the dharma, both concisely and extensively, observe the
| way in which the vajra chain of awareness abides. [n7] If you
| wish to be learned in all of wisdom's secrets, observe the rays
| of the vajra chain of awareness. If you aspire towards insepara-
| ble view, meditation, and conduct, don't be distracted from the
| kaya of the vajra chain of awareness. If you wish to behold the
| celestial palace of all phenomena, internalize the genuine mean-
| ing of space and awareness. If you wish to inherit the lineage of
| Vajrasattva, remain ever one with the kaya of the vajra chain of
| awareness.

Thus, it is taught. In this way, directly seeing the meaning of awareness of
the nature of phenomena is referred to as b.eing equal to the original pro-
tector, Kuntuzangpo. It states in the Secrtt Conduct:' [n8]

| Whoever sees in this way is equal in fortune with the original
| protector, Kuntuzangpo.

Thus, as stated [by the guru],

| Today, the greatest discovery has occurred! Receiving the
| empowerment of the energy of awareness is like encountering
| the faces of three thousand buddhas. By severing the cycle of
| rebirth, you have seized the path that leads to liberation. Even
| if you were to gradually traverse the ten bodhisatrva grounds, it
| is still not certain you would directly perceive all qualities of the
| essence of the sugatas. Therefore, from this day onward, perse-
| vere in the practice of the ultimate qualities of the four visions
| [119] to reach the state of awakening in the exhaustion of the
| nature of phenomena!

So, [the disciples] are filled with inspiration.

Next, there are two ways to insure that the practice is on track. First,
training in four sessions for those who practice with elaborations is as
stated in the Clear Expanse:

| The way to insure that the practice of virtue is on uack is to train
| in four sessions.

Thus, for that, during the first phase of the predawn, meditate on guru
yoga. In the second phase, maintain trekcho; and, in the final phase, medi-
tate upon empty bliss and the fierce wisdom: From dawn to sunup. recite
daily sadhanas, prayers, and so forth; and, &om morning until noon, prac-
tice toga!. In the late afiernoon, [uo] perform prostrations and other vir-
tuous activities. In the evening, practice toga) again. At night, offer torma
and hold the winds. During the first phase of dusk, meditate on imper-
manence; and, for the second phase, practice generation stage and mantra
recitation. In the late evening session, mingle sleep with innate clear light.

In all cases, begin each session by generating bodhichitta while main-
taining the actual practice with nonconceptual awareness. In conclu-
sion, end all sessions with dedication of merit and aspiration prayers. This
is known as •practice united with the three sacred stages.• These [three
stages] arc indispensable.

Second, being without elaborations is as stated in the Lamp 1hat Illu-
minates Appearances:

| Just like the continuum of day and night ...
 
Thus, this is the field of experience for those who are experiencing the
warmth of the fundamental nature [12.1] and who only train in dear-light
togal practice. By forsaking all daily activities and never parting from the
postures, awareness rests inexpressibly in the expanse of the kayas and vital
essence. Dividing the night into three sections, at dusk, assume the posture
of a sage. The key point for controlling the sense organs is to visualize in
your navel an extremely hot red ahtungb 61 upon a four-petaled red lotus.
From that, fire blazes up the central channel penetrating the syllable ham
in the crown. Drops of the vital essence fluid fuel the fire that blazes pro-
fusely, incinerating all karma and habits. Rest within empty bliss.

In the: middle of the night, [u.:z.] assume the lion posture and gather
all knowable things within the vase as follows. Visualize that, within the
heart, there is an extremely radiant white ah. Also, visualize a white ah at

YESHE LAMA I 107
the crown aperture. Between these two, within the central channel, visual-
ize an unbroken chain of crystal-white ahs that dissolve one into the other.
Due to this, the central channel becomes dear like the sun shining through
a window. This is a key point for mingling sleep with innate dear light.

In the predawn, at the very moment of awakening, say ha with three
extended exhalations. Then, assuming the lion posture, imagine that, from
the ah in the heart, a secondah emerges and remains perfectly poised [ 12.3]
about a bow's length above the crown of the head. Focus the mind there.

Similarly, in order to develop the four states of concentration and the
wisdom of nonconceptual cessation, the key point for exhausting the five
branch winds in their own place is as follows. Envision that five red ahs are
stacked one upon the other, [indicating] the dement fire; four white [ahs]
are stacked, [indicating] the element water; three green [ahs] are stacked,
[indicating] the element wind; and two yellow [ahs] arc stacked, [indicat-
ing] the element earth. Then, imagine a single blue ah, [indicating] the
clement space. Meditate sequentially in this way because the syllable ah
abides as the unborn nature and mental analysis resembles fire, the expe-
rience of joy and bliss resembles water, recollections resemble wind, and
[ 12.4] being bound by the antidote of mindfulness resembles earth. This
is a key point for purifying that which is to be abandoned, including the
antidote, taken from the extraordinary wisdom intent of the great pat)Qit
Vimalamitra.

During this practice, increasing the advantageous circumstances even
through conduct is as stated in the Conjunction ofthe Sun and Moon:•

| With conduct like a honeybee, experience the taste of all phe-
| nomena. With conduct like a deer, abandon all objects that
| become the condition for confusion. With conduct like a mute,
| forsake all confused speech. With conduct like a finch, sever
| doubt with the secret method. With conduct like a lunatic,
| [us] forsake a permanent location. With conduct like a lion,
| reject a fearful mind and wander in the charnel grounds. With
| conduct like a dog or pig, eliminate concepts of dean or foul

Supplementary, Concluding Summary

Thus, there are seven stages from the conduct of a beginner who is like a
honeybee and has just begun listening and contemplating up to the con-
duct of a great practitioner for whom bliss, suffering, good, and bad are a
single taste. By assessing conduct according to one's own mind, the view
and meditation will be enhanced accordingly.

Signs That Delineate the Stages ofthe Four Luminosities

Third, the explanation delineating the four luminosities is as follows. In
the Reverberation ofSound it states:

| From this, the four visions manifest. Through the vision of the
| actual nature of phenomena,• [12.6] the rhetoric of the gtasping,
| analytical mind is transcended. Through the increasing experi-
| enceb of the vision, confused phenomena vanish and the wis-
| dom of the bardo is actualized. Through the vision of the full
| extent of awareness,• one transcends the appearances of the path
| of conceptualizing the three kayas. Through the vision of the
| exhaustion of the nature of phenomena,d one severs the conti-
| nuity of the three realms of saqlSara.

Thus, the four distinctions are based on the object to be purified and the
result of purification. Although [the path of the four visions] is similar to
the five paths of the prajnaparamita vehicle, the distinction between them
as slow versus swift is like the pace of a carriage versus the sun and moon.

Among these four visions of the natural, supreme sovereign of all vehi-
cles, the first is the vision of the actual nature of phenomena, as follows.

Vision ofthe Actual Nature of Phenomema

The vision of the actual nature of phenomena is [12.7] that-by training
with the daytime supports of the dharmakaya, the sun and a fire crystal.
and the nighttime supports of the sambhogakaya, the moon and a water
crystal-the obstacle of heat increasing in the eyes during the daytime is
removed so that the temperature of the [eyes] is normal. In the morning
and evening-whUe observing with the nirm~akaya support, a butter
lamp-it is advantageous to practice the path of exertion. In all cases, by
initially famUiarizing with the object to gaze upon, take care not to focus
too closely. Gradually, bring the light just below or close to the side [of the
object]. WhUe doing so, if the color white is predominant. then look to the
right; if yellow is predominant, look above; if green, to the left; and, if red,
look below. If the color blue is predominant, [12.8] look to the center. Ifall
five colors equally appear, just leave it as is. If the appearance of the vital
essence is not seen, then gazing equally with both eyes is the key point.
Once the radiance of the essence of the sugatas in the heart is first seen as
the vision of basic space resembling a pattern of rainbow colors, thereaf-
ter the circular light of the luminosity of the empty vital essence and three
connected subdc vital essences will occasionally appear to be clear whUe
other times obscured.

In the intermediate regions of all of this-like the sun and its rays-is
the inexpressible empty radiance of the awareness of original purity, the
awareness of true seeing appearing as the vajra chain. Like a face and its
reflection in a mirror, [119] the aspect and the nature are one and the same.
From the point of view of interdependence, it is necessary to know this
is why the vajra chain of awareness is referred to as "the cause• whUc also
being •the result.• Until an individual realizes this key point, they will fix-
ate upon the nature of phenomena as something substantial, becoming
caught in obscurity. Such an individual fails to approach the direction of
the phUosophical tenets of the Great Perfection.

Therefore, with awareness dependent upon the key point of the chan-
nels, the indication of liberation is that [the channels] arc narrow and
curved, although subdc. Relying upon the vital essence, the indication of
liberation is that-at the place where they arc curved-two subdc vital
essences connect. Relying upon the key point of the winds, the indication
of liberation [130] is that there wUI be movement. Without allowing
[awareness] to wander, through famUiarity it will be brought into the
enclosure of space and the vital essence. The radiance of all luminosities will
cffordcssly become clearer and steadier. As the three doors relax in their
own place by the arising of the samadhis of bliss, clarity, and no thoughts,
extraordinary analytical prajfia becomes manifest and the mastery of a
great degree of wisdom is gained. At this time, even if there is an interrup-
tion,') liberation in a natural nirm~akaya pure realm will occur. This is
not merely due to the first indication of the appearance of outer space. This
is due to the key point [131] that the truth is being seen through the inner
eye of prajfia, free from obscuring factors. It states in the Clear Expanse:

| Actually seeing awareness is such that, due to the key point of
| seeing the truth, there will be no return to the: three realms.

Thus, it is.

The Increasing Experience ofthe Vision

Second, the increasing experience of the vision is as stated in the Clear Expanse:

| With the increasing vision, determine the degree to which the
| experience is enhanced.

Thus, otherwise bliss, clarity, and no thoughts are generated through the
gathering of wind-mind. The experience of that arc the ten signs of having
purified the object of purification such as smoke, mirages, and so forth.

Since this involves mental fixation, the way this is not liberation is stated
in the Clear Expanse:

| The intellect is explained as the confused relative. [132.]

Thus, it also states in 1he Bodhisattva's Way ofLift:•

| The genuine is not the domain of the intellect.

Thus, it is as taught.

Here, the natural Great Perfection is stated in the tantras:

| Through the arising of the vision of emptiness from within, the
| radiance of wisdom is luminous from without.

Thus, when the inner empty nature of phenomena becomes apparent, that
radiance is the intrinsic nature of clear wisdom, unchanging and increas-
ingly outward. Inwardly, the channels become as clear as light; and, secretly,
the passions arc liberated. Since this occurs simultaneously, it does not rely
upon mental analysis. Due to gaining undeniable certainty, this is referred
to as the "vision of the experience.· The way this increases is stated in the
root tantra: [134] With the ever-increasing experience of the vision, the colors of
wisdom arise externally, vertically, horizontally, unilaterally, and
as varieties of vital essences and kayas that uanscend the objec-
tivity of coarse appearances.

Thus, as the appearance of light increases, space and awareness separate
from the point between the eyebrows.64 Lights of the five colors appear
horizontally, vertically, spherically, like stiipas, locwes with a thousand
petals, like palaces,'~ spears and arrowheads, latticework, like the dots on
dice, and so forth. All these appearances are unpredictable. In addition,
the luminosity of the vital essences appears to be the size of a bean [134]
which gradually increases to the size of a shield. Awareness becomes like a
bird taking flight, a deer running in the mountains, the slow movement of
a sharaJ)a," and the gradual descent of a honeybee upon a Rower.
In brief, however familiar one is with the practice, the vision of light
increases. With relaxation into awareness, there is some familiarity, termed
"having a sense of familiarity: The indication of supreme familiarity is as
stated in the Lamp That Illuminates Appearances:

| At the moment that all appearances arise as vital essences and
| abide as a rich array, this indicates supreme familiarity.

Thus, it can be determined that, wherever one looks, the empty atmo-
sphere [135] is pervaded by the vision of clear light occurring without
movement or vacillation. Then, when the vision of space arises like mus-
lin, it is a key point to gaze in front if the appearances arise horizontally. If
they are square, look to the right; if shaped like a half moon, above; if tri-
angular, below; ifcircular, to the left; iflike a tower, look directly out.

If distinctions arc made concerning the indication of liberation based
upon the degree of familiarity, it is as follows. When space and aware-
ness separate from the point between the eyebrows, the appearance of
the "union of the four aspects of wisdom• brings liberation such that
thereafter s:upsara is not reentered. When arising with angular shapes,
liberated [136] within the appearance of the group formations, there is
liberation in the natural nirmaQakaya pure realm. When all appearances
mature as five lights and the vision of space is perfectly circular, [appear-
ances] arise as group formations, each adorned with four-petaled lotuses.
At the first instant of the arising of clear light, there will be no bardo and
liberation will occur. As the wisdom intent of the Sok H~ir ofth~ Bud-
dha tantra, it states:

| How could it be possible for a fortunate one who has separa-
| ted [space and awareness] four finger-widths from the eye-
| brows to reenter sarpsara? Whoever sees the angular shapes will
| accomplish the noble qualities of the nirm:il)akaya. Whoever
| sees objective appearances as group formations will be as just
| mentioned.

So, it is.

For this reason, the great scholar Vimalamitra asserts [137] that the
appearance of group formations just mentioned is the fruition of the
increasing experience; and, once kayas arise, that is the full extent of aware-
ness [vision]. The great master Padma asserts that from the union of male
and female deity up to the time that the increasing appearances are com-
plete is referred to as "reaching the full extent of awareness." He also states
that the solitary deities could be the increasing experience of the vision. I
perceive [their assertions] as a single wisdom intent. In the C/~ar Expans~
it states:

| When the vision ofkayas arises and increases to perfection, that
| is when the bardo appearances are exhausted, the sambhogakaya
| is recognized, and the bardo is emptied.

Thus, the arisingofkayas is an indisputable indication [138] that the vision
of the increasing experience has reached its conclusion as well as implicitly
indicating the beginning of the full extent. Analogous to seeing a moun-
tain on the opposite side of a valley from both directions, the appearance
of the solitary kaya of a deity depends upon both visions because of the
interdependent nature of this accomplishment. The Omniscient One
clearly defined the distinction between the wisdom intent of the two mas-
ters.(67) All followers who don't understand how to assess the comparisons
concerning genuine basic space conceitedly blun out, trying to convince
themselves that they know something. Their efforts are like child's play. As
the external strength of the visions of dear light increases, the inner dear
light of awareness [139] also arises as samadhi, clairvoyance, omniscience,
and the like.

Vision ofthe Full Extent ofAwareness

Third, the vision of the full extent of awareness is that, without any distinc-
tions concerning the potential of the nature of phenomena-like a face
and irs appearance in a mirror-the nature of awareness is primordially
perfect as three kayas. Throughout all three times, the noble qualities of
the sambhogakaya are perfected as the appearances of the path. It is in this
way that one comes to realize that this is the ultimate meaning of the full
extent of awareness at this juncture in time. Other philosophical tenets
state that, since the essence of the sugatas-the qualities ofkayas and wis-
dom-is obtainable as something that existS, there is expectation. [140]
Their attempts to pursue a goal that leads to individual achievements such
as gaining the major and minor marks with physical features arc predict-
able yet inconspicuous [to them], like a thic£ Conversely, this wisdom
intent of the supreme king of all vehicles is not only inconceivable, it is the
greatest marvel! Those who are incapable of accurately revealing this phi-
losophy will be unable to reveal any genuine meaning, except for meaning-
lessly praising the way appearances arise. The loquacious speech of those
who arc only partially familiar with the scriptures, yet full of intellectual
knowledge about many inauthentic paths, produces the contributing cir-
cumstance of mockery. This occurs through the combination ofboth [141]
blurting and being careless. Therefore, in order to proclaim this secret vehi-
cle in the Snow Land ofTibet, let it be known beyond a trace of doubt this
philosophy is only that of the Sovereign of Conquerors, Drimcd Odzer!

Having said that, the intrinsic nature of the full extent is when the
increasing qualities of awareness gain strength and all appearances become
clear light. Once one is familiar with the nature of the five wisdoms, in
the center of the five formations of the vital essence, the crown protrusion
and half of the deity's head [142] and then the entire solitary kaya arise,
originating from the immaculate purification of the nirmai)akaya. Once
the wisdom of the sambhogakaya reaches itS full extent, all five buddha
families-such as the conqueror ~hobhya-appcar as solitary figures,
then with complete ornamentation, and then with consortS in their fully
perfected aspect. The: principal ones and their retinues arise distinctly in
group formations and arc surrounded by the ma.Qc;{ala's vajra fence and so
forth, originating from the: immaculate purification of the: dharmakaya.
The vision is so perfectly dear that ordinary phenomena are naturally
arrested. Wherever cognition is directed, it is able to penetrate so inani-
mate forms are sc:t into motion and even the body can be seen as parcless
particles. Mountains, crags, and other solid formations [can be: penetrated 1
free: from obstruction. Since the: dualistic mind [1431 has completely col-
lapsed, the: source of any hope and fear is discarded and one becomes like
a rambling idiot. At this time, whatever appears is all-pervasive purity, as
stated in the Blazing Body Relic:

| Whoever becomes familiar with the light will witness objective
| appearances such as the four elements of earth, water, fire, and
| wind naturally vanishing. Gradually, one will unite with the five
| colors, indicating inseparability with light. Furthermore, objec-
| tive appearances will be seen as if by a person gone mad, and
| there will be the ability to travel underground and penetrate,
| without hindrance or obstruction, all mountains and crags.
| Even in water, one will not sink. [144]

So, it is.

All of this reveals the general characteristics of the full extent. To delin-
eate the specific details, it states in the root tantra:

| In the intermediate space between the particles of one's body
| appear windows of light. Delicate light rays emanate from them
| in the form of hooks captivating appearances. The corporeal
| body is naturally arrested, and an unimpeded, stainless light
| body appears marked in the center with a syllable ah. From the
| coil of hair between the eyebrows, light the length of an arm
| span emerges. The crown protrusion appears to be hoisted by
| wind. From the fingers of the peaceful deities light rays gather
| like malas made of beads. This is the soundless activity of the
| mind. [145] From the palace in the cranium all of the wrathful
| deities actually manifest. At this time, one's own body reaches
| the full extent.

Thus, when the body reaches the full extent, appearances without excep-
tion are clearly the pure lands of the five buddhas. From the window of
light in their hearts, radiant light penetrates the ah in one's own heart
through which the great radiant-light empowerment is received. When
light that is an arm span's length from the hair coU is evident, the vital
essence of wisdom wind appears on the crown protrusion in stacks of nine
or five, resembling metal plates. Ultimately, the crown ornament is the
crown aperture.

The meaning of being [146] •hoisted by wind• is that the wisdom wind
enters the space. This indicates a phenomenon unbelievable to behold: the
blazing nature of the major and minor marks. When the wisdom wind
enters the fingers, they appear as five lights; and even the subtle light chan-
nels blaze with the radiance of wisdom so the pores and each and every
particle of one's body are perfected as the pure land of the buddhas-the
essence of the: sambhogakaya. The radiance of the peaceful ma.r;t«ilala of
vajra space and the mat;t«ilala of the wrathful deities in the palace: of the cra-
nium emerges from the: light channc:l in the: aperture of the crown chakra.
Everything in the: upper regions clearly appears as the manifest ma.r;t«ilala of
wrathful deities. Since: this is the lucid arising of sambhogakaya peaceful
and wrathful deities, [147] it is referred to as "the full extent of the body."

SimUarly, when the mind reaches the full extent, the conceptual mind,
mental activity, and consciousness all vanish, leaving only the stainless
space of phenomena. One achieves the six states of clairvoyance such as
the abUity to know the minds of others. One: possesses the eye that sees
the immeasurable pure lands of the victorious onc:s and things at a distance
which are otherwise obstructed by solid matter. The appearances of the
mind are perfectly pure; and, since the mind of emptiness is pure, there is
mastery over the boundless gateways of prajna and samadhi. [148]

In short, through purification of the corporeal body, the channels and
winds are naturally cleansed. Due to that, the temporary gathering of the
constituc:nts61 collapses and the actual coarse connection of the body and
mind is reversed. The subtle dormant aspect, like the Aash of a shooting
star, is when one still holds to the appearances ofboth creation and disso-
lution as stated in the Rroerberation ofSound:

| This severing of the connection between body and mind is the
| exhaustion of the contaminated body, yet the mind's charac-
| teristic of clarity still arises externally. This is clearly observed
| within the element of space like the flash of a shooting star.

Thus, and the quote continues:

| The body becomes pure clear light, and the wind [149] becomes
| like flying sparks. They do not abide anywhere, yet are the nat-
| ural radiance of the ground. This occurs in the manner of two
| aspects of appearances. Then when the connection between
| body and mind is severed, there will be no returning to the three
| realms.

Thus, it is.

Incidentally, here in the Land ofSnow, some philosophers ofother tenets
claim that the appearance of empty form is nothing but confused percep-
tion and that even the four visions of the Great Perfection belong to the
tradition of heretics known as ·viewers of the sun.· Teachers who brazenly
commit the root downfall of harboring aversion to the dharma [through
such claims] belong to the ranks of wolves and cats. [150] Unknowingly
disparaging their own favorite philosophies about the appearance of empty
form, such as found in the Wheel of Timw and others, their limited knowl-
edge is narrow and restricted like a hole. There are others who assert that
to say the state of buddha is without kiyas or wisdoms is a perverted view.
They claim that the [state of buddha] is both an illusory kaya-the ulti-
mate object to accomplish-and genuine truth.

We, on the other hand, understand that the qualities of the essence of
the sugatas are the riipakaya and do not consider this [riipakiya] to be a
confused appearance. Just as the characteristic of the moon is by nature
full, through the vision of the increasing experience, the increase in qual-
ities is the potential of the three kayas perfected as the appearance of the
path. [151] Although appearing in this way, this is merely the reflection of
the radiance of awareness arising externally and is not the essential nature
just as it is. Therefore, we do not fixate upon this as genuine truth. Just as
the moon on the thirtieth day by nature decreases, the key point is that
it is necessary for the essence of externally appearing radiance to become
exhausted. Therefore, we assert that awareness-including the subdc wind
of motion-is pcrfccdy pure and that the appearance of the exhaustion
of the mind and phenomena occurs in the immutable resting place of
the inner space of original purity. That is why a practitioner realizing this
knows that philosophies arc the creation of the intellect and that dispu-
tations arc resolved within the inconceivable nature of phenomena. [I 52·]
When phenomena reach the stage of exhaustion, even one's own philoso-
phy falls apart! At that time, even the upadcsha of the guru vanishes, the
limitations of view, meditation, and conduct arc empty. and there is no
vision of the dharmakaya. Since the continuum of kayas and wisdom has
ceased, there arc no buddhas or sentient beings. In short, nothing what-
soever remains, nothing has gone, and nothing will ever return. Thus, one
must simply rest in the wisdom intent of the Middle Way of nonabiding
in any extreme.

Vision of the Exhaustion of the Naturw of Phenomena

Fourth, the vision of the exhaustion of the nature of phenomena is as
stated in the root tantra:

| The vision of the exhaustion of the nature of phenomena means
| to have emptied the appearances of all other visions and to have
| exhausted the body, as well as the objects of the sense organs.
| Liberated from the confusion of concepts, [153] there is free-
| dom from words as the basis of expression.

Thus, in the scriptures of the Great Yoga on down, from the perspective
of the appearance of method there arc limidcss arrangements of the stages
of generation that must be gathered within the completion stage prajfla of
emptiness.

Similarly, here, in reliance upon the three key points, the motion of the
winds increases as wisdom. By the force of having purified [everything] in
the nature of phenomena, the confused appearances of objective external
elements and the internal confusion of the mind, including the habit of
mental activity, all naturally cease. Even all secret appearances of clear light
dissolve into the nature of phenomena, which is the utterly inexpressible
space of uuth. [154] This is referred to as •exhausted.• Ultimately, it is like
the moon on the thirtieth day, where nothing at all appears even though
the nature of the moon has neither increased nor decreased. The radiance
of awareness dissolves into basic space like the light of a crystal retracted
within.

The nature of exhaustion occurs in two ways. Gradual exhaustion is the
process of the four visions reaching their full extent. In the rare case of
instantaneous realization, at the moment a practitioner of supreme intelli-
gence such as this sees the vision of direct awareness, based on familiarity
and without depending upon the stages of the increasing experience and
the full extent, they arrive at the state of exhaustion.

Whatever the case, it is then that, with the vanishing of the corporeal
body, the enemy of the clements cannot cause harm." [ISS] With the van-
ishing of passions, the clarity of recollection and its basis leave no trace.
With the vanishing of appearances, going, staying, the appearance of the
sun and moon, and so forth all disappear without any remaining impres-
sion. Even the thought that this has occurred no longer exists. This is called
•all appearances of form passing beyond sorrow: At this time, there are two
attainments. Having attained freedom from rebirth, by arising in the kaya
of the great transfcrence,70 one brings to fruition the purpose of beings.
Then, when the stages of the visions arc exhausted, as one focuses on the
gatheringoflight at the fingers, appearances are naturally reversed so that
the support and supported universe and inhabitants [156] arc evident like
the moon's reflection or as in a dream. Even one's own body appears as
though it were a reflection in a mirror, unimpeded and lacking true exis-
tence. What one sees will not be seen by those whose eyes are impure just
as when the king bowed down to the kaya of the great master Padmasam-
bhava, only to touch his own head to the cushion.71

Similarly, by vanishing into particles and becoming dear light, one
attains control over both birth and entrance, which is an exclusive feature
of togal. Through trekcho, the body vanishes into particles and the mind
vanishes into the nature of phenomena so liberation occurs only in the
state of original purity. At that time [through togal], miraculous activities
arc so inconceivable [157] the aims of the six classes ofbeings are fulfilled
both dirccdy and indirectly in their individual realms.71 In particular, the
deed of liberating three thousand human beings with harmonious aspi-
rations •without [physical] remains· is accomplished. Finally, enlighten-
ment in the kaya of the ever-youthful vase of the nature of phenomena will
be achieved, as demonstrated by the living examples Padmasambhava and
the Stainless Teacher ofTruth.(73)

Some of the explanations given by the Omniscient One make reference
to three thousand bardo beings [being liberated]. Since human beings are
in the bardo of the birthplace, there is no contradiction.74

Having mastered entrance, even though at this time there is no great
wave of benefit for others through a kaya, [one can liberate] three thou-
sand beings just by directing awareness. [•s8] Through the key point of
being liberated from the effects of good and bad karma-like mist vanish-
ing in space-dissolving into inner space, the enlightened activity ofinsep-
arable kayas and wisdom is enacted for the: sake of others until sarpsara is
emptied. The radiance of inner luminosity-absorbed without obscura-
tion-becomes the clear, external manifestation of the pure realm of Rich
Array such as the: partial sambhogakaya and so forth arising like a face in a
mirror. From the nature of the unceasing ornamental wheel of enlightened
body, speech, and mind, the five sambhogakaya buddhas appear to the
tenth-ground bodhisatrvas. [159] To shravakas, pratyekas, and ordinary
individuals, the supreme nirmat;lakaya [appears]; and, furthermore, byway
of enacting deeds according to faculties, aspirations, and intentions of sen-
tient beings, the nirm:i!}akaya artisans, reincarnates, and so forth appear.
This is clearly elucidated as well in The Staircase to Altan4htha: which
describes the generation stage.

Supplementary Upadeshas

Fourth, the supplementary upadeshas are as stated in the Clear Expanse:

| The four upadc:shas of the concluding support must be given
| after the: preceding [instructions].

Thus, [the four are] holding the ground with the three motionless states,
indicating the extent with the: three: ways of abiding, [160] striking with
the three attainments, and revealing the status of liberation with four states
of confidence:.

Holding the Ground with the Thru Motionless Statts

For the first, it states in the root tantra:

| By one having established the ground with the three motionless
| states, the wind-mind reaches the full potential.

Thus, when one remains motionless in the physical posture, the channels
and winds naturally relax. When one remains motionless with the gaze of
the eyes, the visions increase. When one remains motionless in an uncon-
uived state of mind, space and awareness unite.

Indicating the Extent with the Three Ways ofAbiding

For the second, it states in the root tantra:

| By indicating the extent with the three ways of abiding, dreams
| are reversed and the signs and limits of the body, speech, and
| mind are identified.

Thus, the body abides [161] without engaging in any activity, purifying the
confused thoughts of sarpsara. Winds abiding without increasing termi-
nates the movement of concepts. Visions abiding without shaking allows
the full extent of the pure lands to occur. At that time, there are two: signs
that arise through the three doors and the extent of accomplishment rec-
ognized in the dream state.

For the first, at the time of the direct awareness of the nature ofphenom-
ena, with the maturing of the body through the vase empowerment, the
meaning of effortless action enters the limbs of the body; and, through the
interdependence of the channels relaxing, the body becomes like a tortoise
placed on a metal tray. When the consciousness enters the channc:ls, by
the radiance of the pure basis of expression entering that which indicates
speech, [162] like a mute, one makes no effort to speak. When the meaning
of the natural liberation of the Great Perfection free from fixation enters
the mind, the mind abides wherever it is placed, like a bird in a trap.

At the time of the increasing experience, through the dissolution of the
winds in the central channel, the meaning of freedom from good and bad
permeates the body. One is freed from feeling shame or self-importance like
suffering from a terminal disease. As a result of the purification of speech
through the secret empowerment, the meaning of the Great Perfection-
free from proving and refuting-enters the speech; and, like a crazy per-
son whose utterances arc unintelligible, one speaks without regard for the:
outcome. When the gathering of the concepts of mental activity enter the
mind-like an individual intoxicated seven times by a poisonous hcrb-
[163] the unborn, naturally liberated mind never engages with sarpsaric
activities again.

At the time of the full extent, when the potential of the prajiia empow-
erment penetrates the channels and winds, one's body is unobstructed by
the five elements. This is like how an elephant stuck in the mud is able
to pull itself out through irs own force. When the meaning of the Great
Perfection beyond speech or expression merges with speech, through the
interdependency of compassion overcome with prajiii, speech becomes
like the sweet song of an adolescent kumbhanda.75 Henceforth, whatever is
verbalized is accepted by and benefits others. [164] When the meaning of
one's own originally pure nature-forever primordially liberated-merges
with the stillness of the mind, it is certain that s:upsara will never be reen-
tered,like becoming immune from smallpox.

At the time of the exhaustion of all phenomena, when the Great Perfec-
tion-having transcended the sense organs-purifies the corporeal body,
like a corpse in a cemetery, one will not have the slightest trace of fear even
if a hundred messengers of death arc hovering. When the syllables that
abide in the channels enter the lattice of wisdom wind, the inexpressible
meaning of the king of all vehicles will imbue the sound of speech. The
sound of empty expression will become like an echo, and only the words
of others will be repeated. [165] An individual whose mind has been puri-
fied by the absolute [word] empowerment will, like the consciousness of
someone whose heart has been pierced by an arrow, have the ability to
instandy discern awareness. Departing for the ground of original purity
like vanishing mist, the freedom of the wisdom of perfect buddhahood
will instandy occur.

Incidentally, it is as stated in the Naturally .Arising:

| When exceptional prajiia arises in the mind, recognize it to be
| a deception of the maras. If fearless conduct suddenly bursts
| forth, at that moment recognize which direction prajiia should
| be placed.

Thus, if one is not certain about how to discern the signs of mind-based
experiences, [166] there will be no liberation from maras or the narrow
passageway of obscuring deviations. If the purpose ofthis instruction from
the tantras is synthesized, three signs are taught: the signs that indicate the
obstacles of micas, the: signs of experiences increasing and diminishing,
and the signs of the unchanging secret.

First, some practitioners with dull faculties will grasp at visions and
fixate upon them as real. Verbally proficient yet lacking the depth of
understanding, they will be able to emanate bodies of various colors, in
the mirror of their own shadow a second reflection will appear, they will
be able to understand the minds ofothers, and so forth. When that occurs,
[167] they should cleanse their body by anointing it with frankincense and
nectar from head to toe or by smearing old clay on their limbs so that the
color changes.76 Furthermore, hindrances can take the form of the deity.
Although pure wisdom 4akinis will not enter the world, 4akinis of vari-
ous activities do reveal their forms in the sky and predict that common sid-
dhis will be achieved. The indication of a deviation will be that the mind
changes to become totally different and gives rise to self-defined attach-
ment-fixation, aversion, refuting, and proving. Becoming more and more
opposed to the dharma in this way is [168] referred to as ·oneselfovercome
by the 4akinis." It is as stated in the Naturally .Arising:

| If a prophecy from the 4ikinis is received, since that is to test
| [one's] experience, focus on the view.

Thus, it is as taught. By maintaining equipoise in the meaning of nonexis-
tence, one will be able to overcome the 4alcinis and there will be no poten-
tial to be deceived or lured by enticing, inauthentic siddhis. Furthermore,
in general, meditating upon wrathful deities, reciting wrathful mantras,
melodiously reciting hung, and meditating upon bodhichiua will bring
about reversal.

Second, the signs of increasing and diminishing experiences are as fol-
lows. By the circumstance of the way the winds and mind combine, a sud-
den sense ofunreliable samadhi will develop. (169] In addition, ifuncertain
visions of forms of deities, light formations, and so forth appear in the
sky, perform the following activities. Sometimes soak the body in water,
other times place two pieces of flat wood sixteen finger-widths in length
underneath the chin as a support and massage the body with sandalwood
oil. Partake of cooling foods and recite the essential sound of the unborn
nature-ah. The perfecdy correct path will again be secured.

Third, the. signs of the unchanging secret are as follows. The body
becomes light like cotton, the complexion fair, and white hair and wrinkles
disappear. Hair and nails stop growing, [ 170] and the mudris and syllables
of the five families appear on one's body. The skin becomes youthful, white
hair rums black, and new teeth grow in. One gains the mastery of a flexi-
ble, supple body. Likewise, by the accomplishment of the truth of speech,
whatever is said brings benefit to others. Words that cause confusion are
nc:ver spoken, and many aspects of the dharma are naturally understood.
One comes to know various ancient histories, languages, and dialects of
the beings of the six classes. The speech of the shravakas, pratyekas, and
bodhisattvas can be heard, the movements of the breath are curtailed,
and so forth. (171] Having cleansed the mind, one no longer needs food
and clothing and can remain in samadhi for months or years. The winds
[mind] can be directed at will. By purification of the concepts of the past
and future, stages of activities cease; and, giving rise to immeasurable com-
passion, passions no longer arise in the mindstream. In short, the crucial
point is to remain unsullied by the intellect that encourages refuting and
proving exueme views based on positive or negative hope and fear.

Second, the extent of accomplishment recognized in the dream state is
as follows. It states in the Secret Sound Tantra:•

| For the supreme, (dreams] will cease; for the middling, [dreams]
| will be lucid; and for the inferior, [dreams] will be uans-
| formed.

Thus, for all of those with keen faculties and enthusiasm, the connec-
tion with karma and habits will be severed. [172.] An indication that bud-
dhahood will occur in that very lifetime is when dreams are purified in
the dharmakaya and sleep arises as clear light. For the middling, dreams
become lucid and, through familiarity with dream uansformation, bud-
dhahood will occur in the bardo. For the inferior, the continuum of nega-
tive habits in the dream state is severed and, by experiencing only positive
dreams, rebirth will be taken in the realm of the natural nirmil)akaya.

Striking with the Three Attainments

Third, suiking the nail of the three attainments is as follows. The quote continues:

| By striking the nail of the three attainments, the contaminated body vanishes.

Thus, if words that convey the same meaning are not continually repeated,
that meaning may not be fully understood. Once mastery over outer
appearances is gained, circumstantial phenomena arise as pure lands. [173]
Internally, once mastery over the magical body is gained, the corporeal
body is purified in clear light. Secretly, once: mastery over the wind-mind
is gained, even a consciousness that has committed the five: heinous non-
virtues can be guided by focusing awareness.

Revealing the Status of Libtration with the Four States of Confidence

Fourth, the: four states of confidence are as stated in the Heap of Precious jewels:

| With the unchanging view of the four states of great confidence:,
| the full extent of irreversible wisdom will be: recognized.

Thus, even though one hears of the suffering of the three: lower realms,
the finitude of life span and so forth, one determines that it is impossible
for bliss and suffering to independently exist in one's own nature which
has never been confused from beginningless time. The: confidence: of not
fearing the lower realms is aroused; and, when awareness arrives upon the
ground, even the: name: "sarpsara• no longer exists. [ 17 4] This is why there
will be the: confidence: of no longer anticipating the ripening of cause and
result. In this way, through liberation in the innate nature: of phenomena,
the thought "this is happiness· no longer occurs. Since there: is no inde-
pendent state beyond sorrow, there: will be: the: confidence of not hoping
for anything to be obtained. Even though hearing about the immeasurable
qualities of the: victorious ones, except for encountering one's own true:
nature, one will know that there is not even a hair tip's worth of something
else that becomes buddha. By encountering this very nature, there: will be
confidence that joy and sorrow arc: pure in the nature of evenness.
Once one has perfected these: four states of confidence:, the instructions
for entering the citadel of enlightenment arc: as follows. It states in Vajra·
sattva s Mirror of the Heart Tantra:

| There are two states of enlightenment: [175) the state of fully
| perfected buddhahood• and the state of fully manifest bud-
| dhahood.h Fully perfected buddhahood means to achieve
| enlightenment without any trace of the corporeal body remain-
| ing; whereas, when the state of fully manifest buddhahood is
| attained, various signs having to do with light, sound, physical
| remains, kayas, the motion of the earth, and so forth will occur.

Thus, concerning the first, this includes the great Chetsun• and all those
who preceded him who were famous for their actual accomplishment.
The latter case includes the Sovereign of the Victorious Ones-Drimed
Odzer-who, in the great charnel ground forest of Chimpu, manifested
among the two lights, circular; of the two sounds, loud roaring; and of
the twokayas, wrathful. [176) He manifested both the sacred remains and
relics that cannot be destroyed by the elements, while a great earthquake
thundered, roared, shook, trembled, hammered, and pounded with great
force. These six signs were repeated seven times as he revealed the state
of fully manifest buddhahood. Without a single sign left incomplete, he
departed for the ground of original purity.

FOR THOSE OF MIDDLING FACULTY

The second section, for those of middling faculty, is a precise explanation
of the instructions on liberation in the bardo as stated in the Revn-bn-a-
tion ofSound:

| If defined by categories, there are four.

Thus, the natural bardo,• the moment ofdeath,• the nature of phenomena/
and existence' arc the four decisive boundaries that delineate the bardos.

THE NATURAL BARDO

First, the natural bardo is as follows. The general condition of sentient
beings [177] is such that the habit of previous passions is impressed upon
the basis of all,• becoming the seed that creates future habits. By the power
of individual karma, there is a force that propels beings to take rebirth in
various environments and classes and states of happiness, suffering, and
indifference. That which is called "potential" means that, through the single
cause of ignorance, the distinctions of duality arc created and, based on the
aspects of the corresponding results, the beings of the six classes appear.

Concerning this, a single substance is perceived differently by each sen-
tient being through the power of their individual karma. For instance, the
substance water is perceived by gods as nectar, humans as water, animals
as a drink to quench thirst, deprived spirits as pus and blood, and by hell
beings [178] as molten lava. Although perceived in those ways, [water] has
no true, inherent existence. In 1h~ Bodhisattva sWay ofLift it states:

| Who has created the ground of the earth as an iron-hot inferno?
| Where does this fire arise from? The Buddha taught that this
| and everything like it is the result of the negative mind.

So, it is as taught.

In this way, the moment that the arrangement of appearances consti-
tuting the three realms dawns, that is entrance into the natural bardo. For
those of us who are human beings, the five aggregates obscure the appear-
ance of five kayas. The elements and sense organs obscure the luster of clear
light. Karma and passions obscure the appearance of the nature ofphenom-
ena. Consequently, there come to be the present independent [179] expe-
riences of happiness and sorrow. Knowing that this leads only to faulted
states of future rebirth, the method to reverse it is determined by under-
standing the way of the natural bardo in order to sever the cord of doubt.
For example, among birds, the finch is extremely clever since before build-
ing a nest it carefully checks to see if there is any danger or threat &om
humans. Once the nest is determined safe, whenever [the finch] enters
the nest, there is no hesitation. Similarly, at this moment of the narrow
passageway, the unsurpassable, indispensable guide is called •the lamp

of hearing that dispc:ls the: darkness of ignorance:." Holding the: meaning
of this in mind, [180] it is important to sever all doubts with certainty
derived from hearing and contemplating.

Nevertheless, since in the present time most beings are tormented by
various degrees of discouragement and degeneracy, it is as stated in the:
[Treasury ofthe] Predous Genuine Meaning:

| During the: Age: of Excc:llc:ncc:, even all gurus were only maha-
| siddhas. Based on the individual's karma and the: guru's com-
| passion and omniscience:, liberation would occur solc:ly through
| the: potency of dharma according to personal karmic connec-
| tions and aspirations. Conversc:ly, nowadays, it is difficult to
| be endowed with such forrunatc: karma. With countless con-
| cepts proliferating, it is almost impossible: to cut through even
| a single: thought. That is why it is essential for all ordinary indi-
| viduals [181] to thoroughly train through hearing and contem-
| plating. Once: one: arrives at the: time: of the: conclusion of this
| heart-essence doctrine:, practice: is then referred to as •devotion-
| based." Given that this king of secrets is the: pinnacle: of all doc-
| trines, except for those: who arc: capable: of great hearing and
| contemplating and whose: wisdom and fortune: arc: supreme:, it
| is impossible: for this meaning to be: realized. Thc:rc:forc:, to enter
| this vehicle: it is necessary to largc:ly depend upon the: cultivation
| of hearing and contemplating.

Thus, and the: quote: continues:

| In particular, the: guru must know the: unmistakc:n path, for if
| not, whatever is taught will be: mistaken. There: fore:, vast hearing
| and contemplation must be: devdopc:d first

Thus, these are my heartfelt words of advice for the beings of the five-hundred-year
period [of degeneration]. [182]

THE BARDO OF THE MOMENT OF DEATH

Second, the: bardo of the: moment of death is as follows. In the: Conjunction
ofthe Sun and Moon it states:

| Life is impermanent, like a traveler on a journey who never stays in one place.

Thus, once there is birth, death is naturally looming. In the Conjunction
ofthe Sun and Moon and all upadesha literature there are extensive expla-
nations on how the signs of death occur and how to deceive death. By
understanding this, one can reverse sudden obstacles. Otherwise, it is as
the quote states:

| There is no direction on this earth where anyone has ever been
| spared the arm of death itself.

Thus, as taught, according to the teachings given in the Sutra ofAdvice
to the King, • the actual boundary defining the time of death [183] begins
when the illness causing the circumstance of death strikes until the inner
breath stops. During that period of time, it is crucial to know the oral
advice so that whatever is vague becomes as vivid as a damsel's image of
herself in a mirror.

In the Conjunction ofthe Sun and Moon it states,

| This is the time that all upadeshas from the guru must merge with the disciple's stream of mind.

Thus, if the dying individual is a Great Perfection practitioner-like a care-
free child not keeping track of details-he or she will be unconcerned with
the signs, place, or time of death. If that is the case, these instructions will
not be necessary.

The best of middling capacity will be indifferent to the circumstances
or place, whether death occurs on a road or an intersection in a city. This is
how a homeless vagrant would die. [184] An average practitioner's death
would be beyond concern for external circumstances, like a wild animal
such as a lion who dies in the mountains, in a cave, or in an empty val-
ley. Engaging with the kayas and wisdom, this is referred to as "entering
the innate clear light" or •entering the pure realms through powab instruc-
tions: In both cases [of entering] success depends upon the power of
familiarity. The visualization for the first is as stated in the Conjunction of
tbe Sun and Moon:

| The way to engage the union of kayas and wisdom is to direct
| awareness as follows. With the body in the sleeping-lion pos-
| ture, direct awareness to the eyes. Allow the gaze to rest momen-
| tarily in space. Ifspace and awareness [185] are stable, the person
| will have no bardo and buddhahood will surely be achieved.

Thus, assuming [one of] the three postures or remaining in the sleeping-
lion posture, focus awareness on the eyes. With eyes directed to the space
of awareness, relinquish the present life and relax uncontrived within orig-
inal purity. In an instant liberation will occur. This is also called •introduc-
ing the secret path.•

Since this is an extremely profound key point, even while one is alive,
when the sky is pristine, direct awareness into space and think, •The
moment of death has arrived. Now I must pass into the peaceful unelab-
orate expanse." [186] Exhale the breath and follow that by allowing the
mind to remain without focus. This path is extremely swift!

For the latter, it states in the tantras:

| The way of entering into various realms is as follows. The teach-
| ings for reanimating the dead and transferring consciousness are
| practiced by the consciousness mounting the winds. For that, it
| is important to have previous experience through training. It
| is also important to concentrate and transfer awareness. Then,
| with bile, [the consciousness] is ejected. This depends upon the
| guru's oral instructions.

Thus, during the final moments of the last breath, awareness as a white ab
in the heart is ejected direcdy up through the crown aperture. By reciting
bile twenty-one times, liberation will occur. [187] Just as mentioned in the
tantras, it is important to train while still alive! Those endowed with this
key point need not depend upon the stages of dissolution. Through the
bodhisattva's manner of transferring breath, they will pass beyond sorrow.

At this time, if clarification through verbal elaboration is necessary, it is
best to receive this from one's guru. If that is not possible, a vajra relative
with undefiled samaya should recite as follows:

| O fortunate child! This clear light is actual wisdom that origi-
| nates from itsd£ Let your mind remain in this nature without
| contrivance, and you will unimpededly arrive [ 188] in the state of
| buddhahood. If through this the mind is still unable to do away
| with concepts, eject awareness as a white ah out of the crown
| aperture like a flung arrow. In the upper direction is the realm
| of perfectly pure space. It is there that the conqueror known as
| King of Space dwells. Endowed with the empowerment of the
| ground-the fundamental nature of the Great Perfection-for-
| tunate one, fearlessly receive it! Depart for the appearance of the
| ground of the nature of phenomena and you will achieve bud-
| dhahood in the ground of original purity. If by chance libera-
| tion does not occur, recognize all appearances of the bardo of
| the nature of phenomena to be your own. [189] At the moment
| you recognize your own nature, joyfully depart for the space of
| original purity.

Thus, having repeated this three times, [the instructor] should also remain
in equipoise.

These instructions are exceptionally sublime because they are drawn
from the Naturally Occurring Grtat Pnftction• and other texts. Here,
despite having received upadesha, if one does not have full confidence, as
with all ordinary individuals, retraction of the channels and winds begins
with the four outer elements, with the five inner aspects of space, and with
the five secret life forces. All additional twenty winds will dissolve accord-
ing to the subtle stages of decomposition. Although this is explained in
detail in the tantra Naturally .Arising. that which is presented here is so
that ordinary individuals can easily understand. [190] The way the de-
ments dissolve and the winds depart is stated in the Conjunction oftht Sun
and Moon:

| When the earth dement dissolves back into earth, the body
| becomes heavy, unable to rise. The ability to stand and move
| diminishes. When the water dement dissolves back into water,
| fluids issue from the mouth and nostrils. Similarly, when the fire
| clement dissolves back into fire, the mouth and nose completely
| dry up. The body loses heat from the extremities inward. Like-
| wise, when the wind dement dissolves back into wind, breath
| becomes erratic, the limbs struggle, and the eyes roll back in the
| head. Whoever experiences these signs is departing from this
| world.

Thus, and in the Cl~ar Expanse it states:

| When the wind that mobilizes the body departs, [191] the body
| can no longer raise itself up and the hamstrings tremble. The
| limbs will not contract, and speech becomes difficult. The eyes
| roll back, and the breath is exhaled. When the wind that gives
| the physical complexion luster departs, the entire body-as well
| as the area around the mouth and nose-becomes a gray color,
| like smoke. Pain shoots through the muscles, and a foul stench
| issues from the mouth and nose. When the wind that separates
| impure substances from pure departs the body, one can no lon-
| ger eat or drink and the strength of the body diminishes. When
| the wind that distributes heat throughout the body departs, the
| warmth of the body escapes from the extremities. The splendor
| and luster ofthe body fades. When the wind of the karma of the
| con escapes, the body trembles uncontrollably and the blood in
| the veins and capillaries retracts into the aorta.

Thus, and the quote continues:

| At that time, [192] appearances dissolve as follows. All outer
| sensory perceptions and recollections dissolve, so that every-
| thing becomes like the darkness of night. Awareness dissolves
| into the center of the heart, memory fades, and speech no lon-
| ger functions.

Thus, at this point, the so-called mind is the radiance of awareness carried
by the wind-mind in the lungs, like a blind horse. When this combination
[wind-mind] separates and the radiance of awareness dissolves into aware-
ness in the heart, it is like a crippled man. All winds without exception pass
through the path of the windpipe to flow out the mouth and nose. When
[the wind] can no longer return, this is called the "separation of mind and
wisdom" or the time of death.

At that time, it is beneficial to rely upon the three precious upadcshas of
the great, profound tantra Conjunction of the Sun and Moon: [193]

| Joining one's mouth and nostrils with the person's whose rec-
| ollection has diminished," forcefully exhale three long breaths
| of air. With the first breath, imagine a white om; with the sec-
| ond, a red ah; and, with the third, exhale and abide in emptiness.
| With each inhalation imagine that the individual's conscious-
| ness returns to their body as a blue hung and in the same instant
| recite hung with such force that the intestines retract to touch
| the spine. The eyes of the individual should then fly open. At
| that time, introduce the luminosity of the empty vital essence
| [194] called pointing-out instructions: ·o fonunatc one, this
| is the clear light of your own nature. At this time of separation
| from your body, the three doors arc no longer an obstruction so,
| although the bardo of the nature of phenomena-including all
| the sounds and lights-arises in all its glory, it is not other than
| your own appearances. You must recognize this! Since this pres-
| ent naked awareness is actual liberation itself. do not deviate!
| Do you sec the appearances? Do you hear these instructions?"

| Thus, if there is a response or a sign becomes apparent, the
| transmission was successful. If there are indications that the
| [individual's] consciousness is clear [19s] or the sense organs
| are vaguely alert, shape paper into a cone or usc a piece of bam-
| boo and place your mouth at one end while inserting the other
| into the individual's car, saying, "0 fonunate child! Don't be
| attached to anything! You have separated from your corporeal
| body of flesh and blood. It is poindcss to be afraid of the bardo
| of the nature of phenomena's radiant light and sound! Recog-
| nize that your own appearances do not actually exist and seize
| the immutable resting place. If you arc unable to abide there,
| bring to mind the pure realm of Great Bliss.• Generate devotion
| and depart! Have no doubt that you will meet with the Buddha
| of Boundless Lighr: 71 Thus, melodiously recite. It is excellent
| if this is recited when the [196] stages of dissolution begin.
| This is an exceptional key point known as •the consummate
| introduction.'"

Furthermore, it states in the Conjunction ofthe Sun and Moon:

| If the dying individual is still breathing, there is no doubt that
| [the individual] will be led from that state by the syllables,
| breath, and so forth.

Thus, most ordinary beings who have never heard this dharma before will
indicate their future place of rebirth through body language and other
signs.

The method to lead them to higher states from the time the death pro-
cess begins until the consciousness departS is as follows. Visualize a white
ah in the individual's heart. Place your mouth close to their crown aper-
ture. [197] As they exhale, slowly and melodiously recite ah as many times
as the ag~ of the dying person. When it is apparent that the person's last
breath has expired, at that very moment recite ah twenty-one times. If
steam emits [from the crown], even though the individual may have com-
mitted many nonvirtues, they will be led to a higher realm. Those already
destined for a higher rebirth will be able to be led to an even higher state.
If by chance an individual displays the signs of a hell-realm rebirth-in
order to prevent their direct descent-at the moment the person sepa-
rates from their breath, visualize the consciousness in their hean as ah and,
while reciting ah, simultaneously imagine that this melts into 6ve lights.
Mingle [198] this with your mind and rest. Ifthe guide possesses high real-
ization, because the consciousness of the deceased is by nature clear light,
this will unite with the truth of the nature of phenomena. As an excep-
tional key point for guiding the consciousness, this is a sublime: feature of
the: king of vehicles.

Like the example of a king on his horse struck by a cannonball 6rc:d by
the minister, all the blood in the body condenses into the aona as pools of
blood surge into [the aorta] in three stages. The length of the breath is also
different [at each stage] during the three exhalations. Finally, when the
outer breath ceases, and the winds dissolve into the consciousness, [199]
awareness momentarily falls unconscious in the: center of the heart. It is
during that state of unconsciousness that the inner breath ceases, as stated
in the Cltar Expanst:

| As the blood in the body condenses, when the [first] pool of
| blood strikes the aorta, both the mouth and eyes become pale.
| Breath is exhaled the length of a cubit. When the second pool
| of blood strikes, the head falls forward and breath is flung the
| distance of an arrow. When the third surge ofblood strikes, with
| the sound ofilt the breath shoots out the length of an arm span.
| Then the outer breath ceases, awareness falls unconscious in the
| heart, and, when the inner breath ceases, that is when the bardo
| of the nature of phenomena dawns. [200]

So, it is taught.

THE BARDO OF THE NATURE OF PHENOMENA

Third, the bardo of the nature of phenomena is as follows. Once the sup-
port of self-fixation-the heap of aggregates-has been discarded, the
dear-light manifestation of one's own innate nature appears. At that time,
it is necessary to possess the oral instructions in order to trust one's own
appearances like a child joining his mother's lap. This analogy reflects the
profound connection between mother and child. Not only that, just after
birth even animals are capable of knowing their mother among many
through their karmic connection, singling her out to suckle without hesi-
tation. The practice of trekcho imbues realization of the ground of aware-
ness as the great nature of original purity abiding like the mother. From
that, phenomena that arise from the appearance of the ground are like the
child. Becoming familiar with that through togal, [101] like a child recog-
nizing his mother and joining her, in the bardo one recognizes that both
the nature and its own strength are like the sun and its own rays. Gaining
certainty that this is not other than one's own appearances, at the moment
of discernment buddhahood occurs without a bardo, like a child uniting
with his mother.

Moreover, [the methods] on this exceptional secret path are as follows.
When all stages ofdissolution of the restricted corporeal body are complete

and the connection between body and mind has ended, the consciousness
of the basis of all-devoid of memory and thought processes-although
said to dissolve into space actually dissolves into the basic space of phe-
nomena. In that instant, the natural clear light dawns like a cloudless
autumn sky. [202] With no boundaries whatsoever, having not fallen to
any extreme, empty clarity arises free from the veil of obscurity. Recognize
and rest in this very nature, without contrivance. This is referred to as the
•ground of the great original state of liberation." The distinction of the six
special features sets this apart from the ground of confusion so liberation
is immediate in the great inner space of original purity.

Concerning this, it states in the Omniscient One's Ouan of Profound
Meaning that the place where liberation occurs when space dissolves
into clear light is called me first instant: This phrase presents the con-
nection with what follows [the second and third instants]. Nevertheless,
the complete upadeshas that represent a conclusive analysis [203] through
oral instructions can be understood in the Lamp That Illuminates the Key
Points of Practice, and other texts. In addition, the concise and extensive
explanations, as well as those given on the obscured and hidden meaning
presented through the six limitations and the four modes,10 are not easily
comprehended. Although I am inclined to shoot the arrow of scriptural
reference and reasoning concerning all of this, given that this is an upade-
sha text and the main emphasis is on the meaning, I have taken care not to
use an abundance of words.

If liberation docs not occur at that time, that which is referred to as the
dissolution of space into clear light" occurs. It states in the Conjunction of
the Sun and Moon:

| This is referred to as an ordinary individual's consciousness
| [204] dissolving into clear light: At the moment the continuum
| of breathing ceases, except for the aspect of one's own organs,
| substantial appearances have ceased yet the thought that they
| arc there still occurs. When the corporeal body is no longer vis-
| ible, the body of light becomes evident. Then the entire field of
| experience appears as the mandala of five-colored light rays.
