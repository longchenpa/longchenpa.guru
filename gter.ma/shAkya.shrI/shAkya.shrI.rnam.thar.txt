A GARLAND OF FLOWERS, THE STORY OF THE LIBERATION OF THE SUPREME VAJRA HOLDER, THE VENERABLE MASTER SHAKYA SHRI JNANA

Homage

TOWERING OVER myriad holders of the knowledge of reality,
Skillful in revealing the excellent path, the Vajrayana, [49]
Supreme Vajra Master, bestow on us goodness and excellence!

You are truly Vajradhara in human form, radiant realization ofthe Immutable.
With skillful means and compassion, with hundreds ofmanifestations,
You enter the illusory dimension and save beings extremely difficult to tame.
Teacher Vajradhara who encompasses all space,
At your feet, Lion of the Shakyas, [50] I bow my head in homage.

Powerful speech of the immaculate Victorious Ones,
Pinnacle of all realized dakas, the holders of knowledge,
True manifestation of the glorious heruka, [51]
At your feet, Lotus King, [52] I respectfully pay homage.
To Saraha, [53] Lord of the Realized Ones in Jambudvipa, [54]
And to all masters of Mahamudra and Dzogchen,
The final path of the Secret Mantra, summit of all profound paths, I respectfully bow.

I call to mind the kindness of Kunga Tendzin, [55] and the succession
of masters, sources of the teachings, who have illumined and blessed
the vast Land of Snow with the drumbeat of the glorious teaching of
the Tagpo lineage. [56]

I call to mind the supreme scholar, the accomplished Jamyang
Khyentse Wangpo, [57] mighty voice of infinite buddhas, Manjughosha
(Jamyang) [58] renowned in all the buddhafields, magic manifestation of
unsurpassable wisdom, union of knowledge and compassion (Khyentse)
and lord (Wangpo) of all holders of the teachings.

I call to mind the bodhisattva Kongtrul Lodro Thaye, who through
what is comparable to a fourth compilation of the ocean-like Word
of the Buddha, [59] enacted the enlightened activity of all Tibetan mas-
ters, thus bestowing good fortune on beings that live in this decadent
time. [60]

I bow respectfully to the powerful and accomplished Master
Shakya Shri, who has realized the innate and primordial reality just
as it is, the very nature of all phenomena, the complete sameness of
samsara and nirvana, extracted from the center of the excellent vase
filled with the mind-blessing of sublime lineage masters.

He is the one who, at the sunset of the doctrine of the sage of
the Shakya clan, perfectly revealed in a direct way (mngon sum ston pa)
the innate reality, the excellent path that brings benefit to all:
the glorious (dpal pa'i) lord (dbang phyug) of realization, the king
of dharma of the definitive meaning (nges don chos kyi rgyal po). [61]

The scriptures say:

| Those who wish to emulate the master, inspired by their faith
| In his liberation throughout the three times, and in
| His qualities of body, voice and mind,
| Enjoy his wondrous deeds like draughts of ambrosia.

Concerning how to begin a text in the right way,
Dandin in his Mirror of Poetics states: [62]

| Auspicious words of homage
| Are the gateway to any teaching.

Accordingly, having first paid homage to illustrious masters at the
beginning, we now offer the exemplary life of Shakya Shri as the heart
of the book.

In this age of disputes, Shakya Shri stands out, the apex of a
victory banner rippling over an ocean of realized beings, the crown
ornament of millions of masters of the doctrine of the essential
definitive meaning. [63] In his lifetime he appeared as a powerful yogin
who, following the exalted path, had gained the direct realization
ofreality. [64]

In truth, he had already awakened in the primordial ultimate realm
countless aeons ago. However, moved by unlimited compassion, he
continued to care for infinite beings afflicted by suffering whose minds,
unhinged by the demons of both intellective and innate clinging to a sel£ [65]
remained in the prison of samsara, tightly bound by the ropes of
negative karma and the obscuring states of mind. In this age,
worse than the age of degeneration, Shakya Shri unreservedly displayed a
magical charisma through the three secrets (body, voice and mind)
of his embodiment. With his deeds, like a white parasol towering over the
three worlds, [66] he planted the seed of the liberating path in everyone
he met, in accordance with his or her capabilities.

From an early age Shakya Shri Jnana was infUsed with a deep
interest in dharma and manifested a marked disengagement with the
worldly. His outer behavior was that of a king of wandering yogins
who sees all marvels of the world like bubbles of water, devoid
of intrinsic value. Inwardly, he lived in a state of undivided
contemplation by the grace of which, in this lifetime, he ascended
to the highest throne of realization.

Here we shall briefly recount the story of his liberation, embodied
in the three cycles of the life [67] of this great sovereign of
ascetics, indivisible from the primordial buddha.

HIS PREVIOUS LIVES

SHAKYA SHRI LIVED an extraordinary life, and the recounting of it
not only has great meaning, but brings significant benefits as well.
Reading his life story will inspire faith in those who have not had the
fortune to meet him directly, and will increase the devotion of those
who have actually been his disciples, so that their faith will not fade
but remain unswerving.

Accordingly, Chandragomin [68] said:

| These good deeds, the signs of great renown,
| Unveil the path of those gone to bliss, [69] and
| Those lacking in conviction will develop faith;
| Thus, virtuous stories are a source of joy.

The names of the previous incarnations of the Lord of the Mandala [70]
Shakya Shri, whose embodiments as scholar and saint greatly benefited
beings, are as follows:

At one time in this age of wrangling, he was born as the arrowsmith
Brahmin Saraha, [71] who was the forefather of an ocean of realized
beings, an accomplished yogin whose fame still today is widespread in Tibet.

Another time, he was born in India as Mitrayogin, [72] inseparable
in his nature from Garland of Skulls, [73] and a magical emanation of
Avalokiteshvara, [74] the supremely exalted embodiment of the love and
compassion of countless buddhas.

Again he was born in India, this time as the scholar Naropa, [75] protector
of the northern gate of the Vikramashila monastic univer-sity. [76]
Later in Tibet he was born as Rigdzin [77] Dorje Dudjom [78] of
the Nanam family, one of the nine heart-sons or predestined favored
disciples of the second buddha, Padmasambhava.

He was also born as Ngamdzong Bodhiraja [79] the mind-son of
Milarepa who was like the source of a river for the lineage of
attainments, and to whom Milarepa entrusted the lineage of the Oral
Transmission of the Dakinis. [80]

Once he was born as Lingchen Repa, called 'the Saraha of Tibet', for his fame
as a highly realized being reached the plains of the Ganges. [81]

He was the disciple of Drogon Phagmo Trupa, also known as Desheg Khampa Dorgyal. [82]

He was born as Nyagre Sewo, crown of all realized Kagyii masters,
whose real name was Rinchen Gyaltsen. [83]

He was then born as Kunpang Avadhutipa Sherab Gyatso, [84] the master
of Perna Karpo, illuminator of the doctrine of the definitive meaning and holder
of the secret treasury of profound instructions of the attainment lineage
of the glorious Drugpa Kagyii. He was the yogin Amkar Lhenkye Dorje who,
in a single lifetime of practice on the secret path of the dakinis,
the swift and blissful ultimate path, flew to celestial realms in his rainbow body without
leaving physical remains.

He also took birth as the minister Denma Changtra or Denma
Yulgyal Thogo who, armed with bows and arrows, enacted the will
of King Lingje Gesar, 85 subduing the enemies of the doctrine and dark,
demonic forces. According to the needs of his disciples and beings to
be trained, Shakya Shri, like a single moon reflecting in many ponds,
manifested inconceivably infinite emanations both in sequence and
simultaneously.

Shakya Shri's previous incarnations were revealed by indestructible
prophecies of the great master of Oddiyana, Padmasambhava. They
were partly remembered by Shakya Shri himself, and partly indicated
by the two 'gentle saviors', Khyentse Wangpo and Kongtrul Lodro
Thaye, 86 by Drugpa Yongdzin, 87 omniscient in the age of decadence,
and by other authentic masters, as stated in the long life prayers that
they composed for him. To recount the lives of all his previous incar-
nations would take too long; those who wish to learn about them can
read the individual biographies.

| Just as the expanse of reality pervades all space,
| The infinite sunlight of your wisdom
| Illuminates whole continents of countless disciples.
| Your compassion, devoid of the slightest conceptual characteristics,
| Like the eternal full moon, does not abandon the sphere of reality,
| But shines propitiously upon qualified disciples, the ponds which reflect you.
| Nature of all Victorious Ones that fills space with a display of emanations,
| From time without beginning, you have led innumerable beings to the natural state.
| Until there is no samsara, the magical display of your emanations will know no end.

THE EIGHT AUSPICIOUS SYMBOLS OF HIS LIFE

THE LIFE STORY of Shakya Shri is told in eight chapters that correspond to the number
of the eight auspicious symbols:

| His birth, the germination of his aspirations in past lives;
| The blossoming at an early age of his enlightened nature;
| His reliance on accomplished masters for instructions that mature and free the mind;
| His life as a yogin, practicing contemplation in secluded places and realizing innate wisdom;
| His life dedicated to practice, his attainment of blessings and siddhis, such as visions of masters and deities and the discovery of profound termas;
| His altruistic accomplishments and charismatic guidance, benefiting others immensely and illuminating the doctrine, inspiring great masters to shower him with flowers of praise;
| His commitment to the restoration of extraordinary sacred symbols, fallen into ruin, of the Buddha's Body, Speech and
| Mind, and the creation of sacred images through the power of his unbounded, selfless intention;
| His disappearance into the great expanse of reality, having completed his work for the beings of this realm.

CHAPTER I. His Birth: the Germination of His Noble Aspirations in Past Lives

SHAKYA SHRI, THE LORD of yogins, was born in 1853 into the Naru family, in a place of
natural beauty near the sacred site of Lhadrag Perna Yangdzong on the northern border
of Drugu, in the highland pasture called Beru. This locality belonged to the Champa
Lingpa prefecture in the province of Chamdo, the center of the various regions of eastern Tibet.

His father's name was Naru Tonden; his mother, Nyatso Dronma, was a spiritual practitioner
of great purity, blessed with a gentle character. At conception and when the time of
birth was approaching, both parents had auspicious dreams. His mother maintained a pleasing aspect
throughout the pregnancy and gave birth to the child without pain.

Like Ratna Lingpa, Perna Osal Do Ngag Lingpa [88] and other major
tertons, [89] Shakya Shri was born with a long tuft of hair; [90] and his
body was adorned with amazing signs indicating the birth of a special
being. Born in the female Water Ox year, he burgeoned like a bud,
manifesting virtue in both samsara and nirvana, much as is described
in the Life Story of Ratnacbuda:

| As the time of birth approached
| Like rays of nectar in the sky,
| The child who clears away the obscurations of beings
| Was born from his divine mother.

| Among clouds of limitless compassion
| Adorned with hundreds of spokes of the light of virtue,
| His magnificent lithe youthful moon body
| Waxed in the sky of meritorious disciples.

CHAPTER II. The Early Blossoming of His Enlightened Nature

EVERYTHING IN SHAKYA SHRI's childhood, even the games
he enjoyed playing, indicated his potential for blossoming into a
great being replete with astonishing qualities. His games were unlike
those of ordinary children. Playing with pebbles, he would pile them up
like tormas [91] or other ritual objects, and would accompany this activity
with his own versions of ritual chanting and songs.
The rope from a water-bucket became his meditation belt. Wearing
it, he would sit content, cross-legged in a state of contemplation with
the appropriate gaze and a radiant halo around him. At times he would
make a throne out of stones; he would then sit on it at length, as though
he were teaching the dharma to his fellow playmates.
When he was four years old, a girl seemingly endowed with the
spontaneous dakini eye of wisdom [92] suddenly appeared from nowhere
and asked him why he was wearing white cloth with red stripes (usually worn by yogins).
The boy replied, "I have just been attending the ganacbakra [93] of the dakinis:

He possessed an elevated perception in telling right from wrong,
and in foreseeing what would bring pain or profit in situations hard to
evaluate. For instance, one day his father and a shepherd's son joined
other men in a fight that broke out between the Chagra and Bajon
branches of a monastery. His mother and the wife of the shepherd's
son were at home, combing each other's hair. Out of the blue, the 
child said to them, "You're spending your time so leisurely while at
this moment your husbands are killing their enemies: The two women
scolded the boy, "Don't say things that might bring bad luck!" and
sent him out of the house.

Later, when the women asked what had happened at the fight,
they were told that on that same day, their husbands' faction had been
victorious over the other camp. From that point on, people around
the boy began to take seriously whatever he said.

He was genuinely disengaged and disillusioned with samsara
and its sufferings. As a result, he neither desired nor pursued worldly
matters. He never fought out of hatred towards his enemies or love
for his friends. It was not his way to complain about his situation,
like saying, "I am a beggar, I have nothing to eat or wear!" and so on.
Upon meeting the destitute or weak, he would weep with boundless
pity and do everything he could to help them. He showed no eagerness
to accumulate things for himself nor would he ask others to make
acquisitions for him. He was not cunning, nor did he engage in gossip
and other meaningless chatter. He preferred to speak of the fleeting
nature of everything. Each day of his youth was spent in that way.

The Tenth Stage Scripture states:

| Just as fire is known by smoke and water by herons,
| The nature of a wise Bodhisattva is known by signs.

As a divine inheritance from previous lives, from an early age Shakya
Shri had an undivided, constant faith in the precious Guru Padmasambhava.
Thus, whenever he heard someone belittling the Guru, he would not
hesitate to challenge that person. As a boy, he served as the attendant
of a monk of a monastic college in Chamdo. The monk had a small statue
of Padmasambhava that Shakya Shri liked very much. He persistently asked
the monk for the statue, but the monk would answer, "I'll give it to you
only if you promise to serve me for the rest of my life".

Then Shakya Shri found a small, carved snuff box on the road
with money in it, probably lost by a traveller who had stayed at the
monk's house. He did not consider using the money for himself, even
to have clothes made, but offered it all to the monk in exchange for
the small statue of Padmasambhava. The monk accepted, and the boy was
overjoyed as he took the statue in his hands. He always kept it with
him as his special sacred object.

The state of contemplation arose in him spontaneously and
continuously, familiar to him from experience gained in previous
lifetimes, and he maintained a firm determination never to disrupt his
contemplation no matter what the circumstance.

This happened before he received any formal tantric empower-
ments, explanations or instructions from teachers. From the age
ofsixteen or seventeen he manifested many splendid inner qualities, each
more noteworthy than the last. At times, he would experience the true
face of naked empty presence and openness, the authentic condition.
Despite these remarkable qualities, he was never tainted by the slightest
pride at being an exceptional person. He was more humble than
an ordinary dharma practitioner. Living the life of a supreme hidden
yogin, Shakya Shri never used his clairvoyance to make predictions
for people about gods and demons, and neither praised the pious nor
despised the wicked. He never altered his appearance or behavior in
order to impress the rich or to gain their favor. In this way, he was
unlike many of those recognized as saintly incarnations.

He came from an exemplary family. As Sakya Pandita [94] states, "In
most cases, children model their behavior on that of their parents:'
Due to the formidable strength of his training in past lives, his exalted
nature was complete in every respect. This majestic being was like the
divine wish-fulfilling tree of the gods [95] as described in The Descent
into Lanka scripture:

| He sees birth as entering a beautiful park.
| He goes through times of prosperity and decline,
| But remains untainted by passion and pain.

Shakya Shri took birth consciously because of the overwhelming
compassion he felt for those who suffer. He entered the world just as
the king of kings would playfully enter the garden of his palace. Most
certainly this is the sign that he realized the equality of the cycle
of life and liberation, which is the realization of the sameness
of all things. His fame spread like the unfolding petals of
a white lotus, untainted and unaffected by the suffering of
any form of existence, and so the fragrant scent of his
spontaneously accomplished deeds spread everywhere, for all to enjoy.

| Though his body was still immature, like a tender bud,
| Through the power of his awakened nature from his past expenence,
| The hundred-petalled flower possessed of a thousand sublime qualities
| Unfurled to spread its fragrance everywhere.

CHAPTER III. His Reliance on Accomplished Masters for Instructions that Mature and Free the Mind

As SHAKYA SHRI GREW UP, his uncle Perna, an attendant of
Lama Drugon Chogyal Tendzin Gyatso, [96] made arrangements
for him to enter the monastery of Drugu. [97] There Shakya Shri offered
a tuft of his hair and took the vows of a celibate lay practitioner [98]
from Chogtrul Chogyal, who was a supreme incarnation and a king
of the teaching.

As his first responsibility, Shakya Shri was assigned the task of
preparing and serving tea to the monks. From time to time he was
able to leave his duties and pay a visit to Tenpe Nyima, the sixth
Khamtrul Rinpoche, who was staying in secluded retreat at Lhadrag
Yangdzong. [99] Once when Shakya Shri was discussing his understanding
of spiritual matters with Khamtrul Rinpoche, the latter cut through
his disciple's uncertainties regarding the state of realization and in a
joyful mood gave him a skull cup filled with curd. Thereafter, he gave
Shakya Shri the Introduction known as The Mahamudra of the Innate Yoga [100]
with the following words of advice, "0 excellent son! You belong to
he enlightened lineage. Remain in the undistracted state! That alone
is sufficient practice:'

From then on, whenever he could find time, Shakya Shri would
apply himself in formal sessions, sitting cross-legged with the proper
gaze in a state of contemplation. Baro Chokyong and other young
monks of the monastery teased him, mocking him with nicknames
such as 'Perna's nephew with the big nose:They would say, "Hey, what
are you doing?" and poke his body with needles and burning incense,
causing blisters to appear. Nevertheless, he never said anything, and
faithful to the four ascetic disciplines, never became angry. [101]
During the day, he did not have time for formal practice, but at
night he would sit upright against the central pillar of the monastery
kitchen on a seat made of stones, and remain there until dawn. Apart
from a short interval of sleep in the middle of the night, the rest of the
time he would spend in a state of contemplation. He was an example
of perfect asceticism.

In that period, he had visions of deities from whom he received
prophecies. Tragtsen, Chagme, Tseringma [102] and other guardians of the
teachings manifested to him in their actual form and gathered around
him like attendants, constantly helping and protecting him.
When Chogtrul Chogyal and the other lamas and monks of
Drugu monastery travelled to nomadic areas to collect offerings,
Shakya Shri followed them barefoot, a humble servant. He set his
mind unwaveringly on the destination and diligently followed the
caravan, and while travelling he constantly dedicated himself to his
contemplative practice.

Sometime after this journey, Tsognyi Rinpoche (1849-1904) of
Nangchen paid a visit to Khampagar monastery, the residence of his
root master Khamtrul Tenpe Nyima, and requested teachings from
him. Shak.ya Shri and some monks from Drugu Monastery accompa-
nied Drugan Chagyal to Khampagar to attend Khamtrul Rinpoche's
teachings. At Khampagar, Drugan Chagyal told the monks who had
accompanied him that they could also attend the teachings.

The monks mockingly called to Shak.ya Shri by his nickname,
and said, "Nephew of Perna, go put our horses out to graze. This
task will be your teaching and initiation!" Drugan Chagyal overheard
the monks, and he, a sensitive being, became angry and rebuked them,
saying, "You don't realize what kind of a person he is! Make sure that he
comes for the initiation and hears the teachings with us!" Thus Shakya Shri
was able to receive the initiation and teaching with all the
other monks. Every evening the monks would discuss the teaching
they had heard that day from the master, but they were unable to say
much since they had understood so little of it. However, Shak.ya Shri,
gifted with exceptional memory, and introspective since early childhood,
had understood perfectly what the master had taught. Then, for
the first time, the monks noticed Shakya Shri's qualities and began to
appreciate and respect him.

On one occasion, while Shakya Shri was reporting to Tsognyi
Rinpoche on his progress in his practice, one monk shouted up from
below, "Nephew of Perna! Come down and start the fire in the kitchen!"
Hearing the monk, Tsognyi Rinpoche called down, "Well! It seems
that without the nephew of Perna nobody in Drugu monastery can
keep the fire going in the kitchen". Laughing loudly, he added, "One
day you will beg to drink his piss!".

Palchog, Pekar, and Norbu of Drugu monastery and other lamas
and monks from the area were training together in the yantra exercises
associated with the six yogas of Naropa. [103] Amongst them, Shak.ya
Shri demonstrated an understanding of the nature of the channels,
energies, and vital essences [104] of the vajra body, and a grace in the yogic
movements far superior to the other practitioners. Upon executing the
exercise known as the vajra leap, [105] Shakya Shri lightly touched the ceiling beam
of the hall with his head. All the tantric practitioners present
could see that he remained suspended cross-legged for a while in the air.
At the end of this group training, Tsognyi Rinpoche called on Shakya
Shri, and handed him a bowl of rice, saying that this would create an
auspicious connection. He encouraged him to develop his exceptional
practice further. Feeling boundless devotion for this teacher, Shakya
Shri composed a prayer of supplication to him. Tsognyi Rinpoche
often gave him special instructions, introducing the nature of mind.
However, with respect to the true nature of the mind that he had
already experienced, nothing was added or changed.

Then he chose the secret path, 106 entering the lineage of the oral transmission
of the dakinis. He had been urged by his masters and by a dakini's prediction to do so.
He took Chozang Drolma of the Thotsawa family, who bore the signs of a dakini, 107
as his secret partner for training in the so-called 'other-body method', a conduct chosen
to advance progress toward realization. Such a method, applied when the right level
of preparation has been reached, can lead swiftly to an experience of
the highest bliss. Monks and lay people developed wrong
views about this practice, and began to belabor Shakya Shri with criti-
cism and abuse. Viewing all praise and blame as an echo, he remained
in the state of contemplation, greatly enhancing his realization. Many
auspicious signs appeared, indicating the lengthening of his life span
and the blossoming of his dharma activities; his good qualities waxed
like the full moon.

His first place of practice was the Great Cave of Evam in Drugu,
otherwise known as the Great Dwelling of Drugu. When he undertook
strict retreat there, he had with him only a cracked day pot to boil water,
with a flat stone for a lid. He wore simple cotton clothing and went
barefoot. He practiced day and night. At night he knotted his hair on
the top of his head. During his long meditation retreat, his hair and
clothes became white with lice and lice eggs, like white grains strewn
everywhere on the ground. When he had no roasted barley flour 108 to
cat, he would beg for food, walking about in the vicinity of Drugu
monastery. He lived on whatever he was given and dedicated him;;elf
solely to his practice.

He was not inclined to comply with the wishes of worldly people,
criss-crossing villages, living off the offerings of devotees, monasteries,
and so on, in exchange for performing ceremonies. Rather he would
be content with whatever small amount of food or clothing he was
given freely. If he happened to be offered only half a bag of grain, he
would live on that.

Not much later, many people began making offerings to him,
becoming his benefactors, so that he never again had to make do with
so little. Starting with Chogtrul Chogyal Rinpoche, several lamas and
incarnate teachers of Drugu monastery became increasingly fond of
him, especially Vajradhara 109 Khamtrul Rinpoche Tenpe Nyima. It was
this master who transmitted to him the profound Mahamudra teach-
ing and instructions of the peerless Drugpa Kagyii tradition of the
final meaning (which was Shakya Shri's main practice). Giving inner
and material benefit, Khamtrul Rinpoche bestowed his incomparable
kindness on Shakya Shri.

At a certain point in his life, Khamtrul Rinpoche took a secret
consort as an auspicious condition for prolonging his life and thereby
ensuring his enlightened activities. The rules of the Khampagar mon-
astery were strict and some arrogant young monks lost faith in him
because of that. Filled with contempt, they said, "He deserves to be killed!"

Khamtrul Rinpoche charged Shakya Shri with the delivery of
a sealed letter to Drugpa Yongdzin Rinpoche. Shakya Shri walked
barefoot day and night to fulfill his master's instruction. Some
of his benefactors who lived by the side of the road he was taking, seeing his
feet lacerated by thorns and thinking he must be suffering greatly from
walking in the snow and the cold wind, offered him a pair of shoes
and asked him to wear them. He replied, "I can endure any difficulty
to fulfill the command of my root master even at the cost of my life!"
and continued on his way without stopping.

Riding the horse of inner fire, he returned after more than two
months, bringing sealed letters from Drugpa Yongdzin which he de-
livered to the labrang or residence of the lama (Khamtrul) and to the
monastery. The letter dispelled all outer and inner misconceptions that
had arisen in the community regarding Khamtrul Rinpoche's conduct.
Khamtrul Rinpoche was very pleased with the result of Shakya Shri's
mission and out of gratitude invited him to take his meals at his
residence.

While Shakya Shri was staying in retreat at Lhadrag Yangdzong,
Khamtrul Rinpoche paid him a visit with the purpose of giving him,
in its complete form, the common and special maturing and liberating
instructions of The Mind Essence of Samantabhadra, a terma rediscovered by
Chogyur Dechen Lingpa. On another occasion, Shakya Shri received
from him the Cycle of Blue Guru Tragpo, [110] a profound terma of Rigdzin
Chogyal Dorje, [111] that of White Jambhala, and so on, and in particular
the cycle of teaching The Heart Essence of Longchenpa (a terma of Jigme
Lingpa which had been transmitted by Khyentse Wangpo).

Shakya Shri met Jamyang Khyentse Wangpo three or four times. On
these occasions he received from him the initiation, the liberating
instructions and additional teachings on Guru Dewa Chenpo ('Master
Great Bliss', a terma of Khyentse himself). He also received the earth
tcrma of The Great Compassionate One as the Mind at Rest; [112] The
Pure Vision of Chandali, the Mother of Life; [113] The Quintessence
of the Dakini; [114] as well as the initiation, transmission and teaching
of the terma The Great Compassionate One, the Lotus King;
and the initiation, transmission and the yellow scrolls [115] of
the terma of The Union of the Three Roots. [116]

Khyentse Wangpo empowered him with these transmissions and
then requested Shakya Shri to be their holder. He then asked Chozang
Drolma, Shakya Shri's consort, to recite one billion Guru Rinpoche
mantras. Khyentse Wangpo gave Shakya Shri advice in the form of an
uncommon and indestructible vajra-like prophecy, crowning him with
this white flower of praise:

| The teachings I have bestowed upon you comprise specific advice
| on how to work for the welfare of others. In particular, I have
| carefUlly given you many instructions, introductions, and expe-
| riential guidance on the total relaxation of primordial purity or
| tregcho, and on the direct leap related to spontaneous perfection
| or thogal.

| I gave these in a precise and orderly way: experiential teaching
| on the Mother and Son Heart Essence,m beginning from the relative
| common preliminary practices, then the special preliminary
| Dzogchen practice on the separation of samsara and nirvana, [118]
| and so forth. In particular, I gave you the initiations and
| instructions of the Heart Essence of Chetsun, [119] which is
| the quintessence of the secret instruction series (man ngag sde)
| of the Dzogchen teaching.

| You have humility, and are the ideal person for this teaching. I
| am not flattering you. You will accomplish the innermost, secret
| and supreme Dzogchen view and meditation. It is best that you
| eschew spiritual activity that involves mental elaboration, like
| giving initiations and verbal transmissions. You have created a
| connection and aspire to benefit countless beings through practi-
| cal teachings on the view and meditation. Keep this in mind.

Khyentse Wangpo also gave Shakya Shri an extraordinary teaching that
explained the identical profound meaning of Mahamudra, Dzogchen
and Madhyamika. 120 As Shakya Shri was leaving, he advised him
toseek the initiations and teachings of The Four-Part Heart Essence
from Jamgon Kongtrul Rinpoche.

Shakya Shri followed his advice and went to Kongtrul Rinpoche.
One day in the period when the initiations were being given, he was with
a monk from Ling Dzachukha monastery 121 when the monk fell into
a river and was swept far downstream, in danger of drowning. Shakya
Shri was able to rescue him, but thus missed part of the initiations
of The Heart Essence of the Dakini that Kongtrul had been bestowing. When
he finally arrived, Jamgon Rinpoche gladly repeated the initiations for
his sake.

At other times, Kongtrul conferred on him the initiations,
transmission and teachings of The Single Cut of Dzogchen that Liberates All,
a terma by Rinchen Lingpa; the initiation and the teachings of The
Essential Vajrakila, a Profound Dharma of the Oral Lineage; The Commitments
of the Altruistic Mind of Awakening in Accordance with the
Madbyamika Tradition; [122] The Amitabba Rite belonging to the Sky
Teachings; and others. [123]

Having given him these transmissions, Kongtrul prophetically ex-
horted Shakya Shri, "Now is the time for you to nurture your disciples!
You have created the karma and made the aspiration to increase the
welfare of all beings everywhere:' In that way Shakya Shri also received
the kindness of Kongtrul's blessing.

Jamyang Khyentse Wangpo called upon Adzom Drugpa and, refer-
ring to Shakya Shri, told him, "This togden 124 of Drugu monastery
needs to receive the initiation and teaching of The Translucent Knowledge. 125
I will give him the initiation and then you can give him the teachings
and instructions in detail:' Thus, Shakya Shri received the benevolent
teaching of Adzom Drugpa. From Adzom Drugpa he also received
the initiation and teachings of The Union of the Secrets of the Dakinis, a
profound treasure by Choma Menmo; 126 The Pur!fication of the Buddhtifield
of Great Joy of Vajrasattva; The Q!tintessence of the Master; and others.

From Dza Paltrul Rinpoche 127 he received the profound teaching
on The Guide to the Bodhisattva's lazy of Life of Shantideva. [128]

When Shakya Shri visited the monastery of Kathog, Lama Trime
Shingkyong Jigme Yonten Gonpo 129 was staying in strict retreat. Shakya
Shri was told that it was difficult for anyone, important or not, to meet
the master. Nevertheless, that same night Shakya Shri was received by
Yonten Gonpo and was given the complete Detailed Teaching on the Mind
Cycle of Dzogchen. 130

In the presence of Dzogchen Khenpo Perna Dorje 131 he heard the explanation
of The Prayer for Rebirth in the Pure Land of Sukhavati (belonging
to the series of Namcho or 'sky teachings'), committed to writing by
Karma Chagme. 132

From Khrom Gyalwa Changchub of the same monastery he received
teachings that established a spiritual connection with him.

Shakya Shri met Lama Mipham Rinpoche on two occasions while
Mipham was staying at the hermitage of Gatragu. Shakya Shri had
been in retreat for a long time on the Dru mountains, and during a
period of relaxation from his retreat, was giving teachings to about five
hundred disciples. One morning at dawn, he beheld for a long time
in the space before him a spontaneous vision of an orange-colored
Manjushri with one face, hair knotted on the crown of his head, and
four arms holding a bow and arrow. He saw that the Manjushri
of his vision had the same nature as Jamgon Mipham Rinpoche and said
that this was a sign that he should meet him.

Shakya Shri sent a disciple with the auspicious name of Jamyang
Losal, 133 an acquaintance of Mipham Rinpoche, with the message
that he wanted to meet him. On the way the messenger faced perilous
situations, like encountering yellow bears and floods, but fortunately
he came to no harm. He finally reached the residence of Mipham
Rinpoche and delivered the message, and after Mipham Rinpochegave
his consent to meet with Shakya Shri, he returned. Arriving in the
presence of Shakya Shri, Jamyang Losal handed him a letter and other
things sent by Mipham Rinpoche. The master smilingly asked him,
"Did you run into any danger along the way such as floods or yellow
bears?" and by saying that gently demonstrated his clairvoyance.

Losal told the master that he had delivered the message, and
recounted how on the way there he had experienced some difficulty
due to the floods, but had not suffered any injury. "Well then, there's
no problem;' said Shakya Shri and immediately asked preparations be
made for the journey to Mipham's place. He set off at once with his
son, Tsewang Jigme, Tunge (a nickname of Jamyang Losal) and others
who knew the road well.

On the evening when Shakya Shri was nearing the hermitage of
Gatragu, Mipham Rinpoche called upon Osal, one of the people living
close by, and said to him, "Keep a measure of milk on hand today, cut
some wood and leave it in the meadow over there:

As soon as Shakya Shri arrived at the hermitage, Mipham Rinpoche
sent a monk called Karu to offer him the milk, the wood
and a tent where the guests could stay, and Karu explained that the
master had instructed him to do so, saying "The master wants you and
your son Tsewang to come see him immediately:' Mipham Rinpoche
was extremely pleased to meet Shakya Shri, and they spent a long time
together discussing in great detail the ultimate view.

Mipham Rinpoche told him many times, "O sovereign among yogins, the vastness
of your realization has no equal all the way to the Ganges. You have realized the state
of Vajradhara." He then gave Shakya Shri the transmission and the explanation
of the Aspiration of Samantabhadra and also added 'Jnana' (primordial wisdom) to Shakya
Shri's name. Togden Rinpoche (Shakya Shri) told Mipham Rinpoche,
"You are the actual presence of Manjushri, an adept who has attained
realization, a great scholar in the five fields of knowledge:' 134 Feeling
undivided faith and devotion toward this master, Shakya Shri stayed
at his hermitage for fifteen days.

Every day he would meet with Mipham Rinpoche, and together with
his son received the transmission of The jewelled Necklace of
the Hundred Thousand Names of the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas;
The Means of Accomplishment of the Peaciful Manjushri belonging
to the tradition of the tantras together with its specific set
of associated activities; the collections of Songs and
Advice; the transmission and an extensive explanation
of The Kamashastra, the Treasure of Joy of the Universe; 135 and
The Explanation of Jiarious Difficult Points of Sutras and Tantras:
all teachings that figure among the collection
of writings by Mipham himsel£ Thus the mind-streams of these two
learned and accomplished masters merged into a single Row.

During these days, Mipham Rinpoche also gave audiences to the
people who had accompanied Shakya Shri and would always praise him,
telling them, "You are fortunate to live with such a master. Practice
in the appropriate way. That will be sufficient. I am an old man. It is
meaningless that you come to me:'

At the end of the fifteen days, the two teachers, with heavy hearts,
reluctantly parted company, and Shakya Shri returned to his own
place. Upon reaching the Dru mountains, Shakya Shri continued as
usual, alternating his practice in strict retreat with giving teachings to
his disciples. The next year he, Togden Rinpoche, left for the sacred
place of Tsari. 136 On the way he stopped at the hermitage of Dzongo
in Chamdo where once again he met with Mipham Rinpoche and they
spent the next three days together. They discussed the journey Shakya
Shri was undertaking.

One day when they were performing a ganachakra in connection
with the Seven Mrses of Praise to Guru Rinpoche,137 Shakya Shri offered
Mipham a gold ring adorned with an exceptional diamond and asked
Mipham to write a commentary on Chanting the Names of Manjushri, the
King of Tantras. 138 Then for three consecutive mornings Mipham, as if
entrusting Shakya Shri with the responsibility for the teaching, gave him
the transmission of The Prayer that Pac!fies the Times of Decline, The Guru Yoga
of the Seven Mrses and its commentary entitled White Lotus. When Shakya
Shri was about to leave, together the two masters, outside the gate of
the hermitage, performed the ritual of burning juniper139 composed
by Ling Gesar. With great affection Mipham circumambulated three
times around Shakya Shri's felt tent and then bade him farewell.

Briefly, this is the way in which Shakya Shri perfected his learn-
ing, reflection and meditation. Whenever he offered the mandala of
his realization of the nature of the mind 140 to his root masters, they
would shower him with great praise. All these masters who had realized
His Reliance on Accomplished Masters 63 the state of Vajradhara considered Shakya Shri
as their mind-son, and certainly he became equal in realization to his teachers.
In the eyes of the common people he was a buddha in the form of a human master.
In the dimension of luminous darity 141 his profound and ultimate mode
of being was spiritually nurtured by the infinite wisdom of
the Three Roots (guru, deva, dakini).

| Though you had already achieved the highest freedom,
| Knowing that total trust in the spiritual teacher
| Is, in every respect, the essential, authentic and best path,
| You, a human manifestation of the supreme buddha,
| Trained at the feet of many guides and heroic bodhisattvas,
| Masters who revealed the good path of the Victorious One,
| Respecting them as saviors of the world.

| Your awareness, far superior to the ordinary,
| The magnificence of your jewel-like qualities, your clairvoyance about past lives,
| Your spontaneous faith and perseverance, and so forth
| Have spread the word of your fame.
| Hundreds of rivers have poured manifold profound teachings
| Into the unfathomable depths of the great ocean of your supreme mind.
| Faithful to the hundreds of commitments of a sage,
| You, a magnificent sun, shine unceasingly and eternally.

CHAPTER IV. The Yogin Contemplates in Secluded Places and Realizes Innate wisdom

SHAKYA SHRI SPENT many years of intensive practice at Lhadrag
Perna Yangdzong, in the Long Vajra Cave, and in other places.
When he was practicing meditation above Chogarteng monastery at
his retreat place called Solder, a group of simple-minded, arrogant
young monks staying at the old Drugon monastery, having convinced
themselves that in the Chugoshog caves an unwholesome mix of pure
and impure had developed, said disparagingly, "A bunch of families and
women live in that place:' With such critical and negative talk, these
monks caused harm in the same way that Hindu fanatics disturbed
the Buddha.

As this occurred the omniscient Drugpa Yongdzin was travelling in the district
of Chamdo, for the sake of the doctrine and beings.
Shakya Shri went to meet him and Drugpa Yongdzin viewed him as
ifhe were Lingchen Repa in person. 142 The two teachers discussed their
experiences and realization. Drugpa Rinpoche was extremely pleased
and said, "Oh, it is marvelous that in this place there is such a great
hidden yogin!" and joined his palms at his heart as a sign of respect.
He praised the Master endlessly and gave him the name Shakya Shri.
From that time on he became known as Togden (meaning 'realized
one') Shakya Shri.

Thereafter he was held in great esteem, and thus new doors for
the expression of his charismatic capacity and altruistic work opened.
Those who had harbored wrong views about him and who had belittled
him felt great regret and sincerely admitted their mistakes. Afterwards,
they established an auspicious connection with the Master, and then
with faith and respect became his disciples. Shakya Shri took them
under his spiritual care, giving them teachings and encouragement to
practice. In the course of time Shakya Shri became the trail-blazer
who opened a mine of great meditators throughout the central and
border regions of Tibet.

Khamtrul Tenpe Nyima (Dance of the Victorious Lotus-Born),
Jamyang Khyentse Wangpo (Sovereign of All Teaching), and other
sublime masters gave Shakya Shri the introduction to the state of pure
awareness. This, together with his perseverance in practice, was like wa-
ter and fertilizer nurturing the field of his faith. In this way, Shakya Shri
applied the instructions of his masters. For him, the magical display of
all aspects of samsara and nirvana, both created by dualistic perception
involving the observed and the observer, spontaneously ceased in its
own totally insubstantial condition, like a dream or illusion.

Everything self-liberated in its own nature. At all times he was
unperturbed, in the state of naked awareness of primordial purity
endowed with the three wisdoms. 143 Though he experienced countless
pure visions, he did not have the slightest impulse to cling to them. He
allowed whatever he experienced to vanish spontaneously, like birds
that fly through the sky leaving no trace. He remained in the infinite
great yoga of space, without clinging to anything. Nonetheless, without
closing the door of wisdom that knows diverse appearances, he paid
close and cautious attention to the relative truth of actions and their
consequences.

Shakya Shri became concerned that his disciples might be given
too many offerings while seeking alms, a circumstance that could create
resentment among other practitioner communities nearby who receivedless.
He also believed that possessions might become a source of worldly
involvement for his disciples, and therefore he allowed them
to accept only minimal offerings. With the exception of elderly
disciples needing to undertake a journey, he did not permit others
to travel by horse or other means of transport. He forbade his
disciples to hoard, or to engage in commercial activities,
allowing them, however, to beg twice a year for basic necessities:
in summer for a month (for butter, cheese, and so forth); and for
a month in autumn (for grain and roasted barley flour). He
preferred they wear monks' robes and only in certain cases
permitted some tantric practitioners to dress differently. Moreover,
he advised his students to conduct themselves in accordance with the
rules of monastic discipline.

Every day, a gong sounded to mark both the morning and after-
noon practice sessions, and his hermitage was kept in strict isolation.
No person or animal was allowed to wander around within its precincts,
and conversation was not permitted. Such an atmosphere inspired those
addicted to laziness, and other ordinary people who stayed in Shakya
Shri's hermitage even for only a day or two, to feel a sense of surfeit
with samsara and 'so disengage themselves from worldly involvement
and dedicate themselves to practice. From the tenth month to the first
day of the fifth month of the lunar calendar (November to June), most
of his disciples would observe silence. During this time reading and
studying books, writing, or distracting talk about places, clothing or
food was strictly prohibited, and he forbade the chanting of rituals to
please benefactors, whether relatives or not.

Most people around him were persevering in the practice of the
ultimate meaning, 144 arising early in the morning and going
to bed late at night. When Shakya Shri took breaks from his retreat practice,
he would receive the numerous people who came to see him. Either once
a month or once a year, he would send any offerings the visitors
gave him (either for the sake of the deceased or the living) to his masters
and to various monasteries in the area for the support of monks.

During his life he never harmed a sentient being. Concerned that
the meat he was offered might be from an animal intentionally killed
for him, he consumed meat only from an animal who had died a natural
death. He would do the practice of confession and purification when
he ate meat and frequently he would request lamas and monasteries to
perform these practices for his sake.

We can know this also from the letter that Adzom Drugpa
Rinpoche once wrote to him. That letter said: "Great being, who regards
even cow dung as gold (that is, who regards even such an ordinary
person like me as worthy of great respect), you have offered me gold
earrings set with fine coral with the request to perform confession and
purification for you, since you have to eat the many varieties
of meat that your disciples offer you. Accordingly, with a good intention I car-
ried out the practice in connection with the Aspiration
of Good Conduct. The assembly of practitioners has also performed the hundred part
Peaciful and Wratlful Deities that Spontaneously Liberate into the State
of Realization, and long life and dedication prayers, for which you offered eight
silver coins to each member, and other gifts:"

He advised his non-residential disciples like Jamyang Tulku from
Trayab monastery, 145 as well as disciples in residence, not to eat meat
during the summertime. In case meat was bought he strictly forbade
purchasing meat of an animal specifically killed for them, unless they
were persons endowed with superior qualities, free of defiling faults. He
would advise them not to misuse offerings given for either the deceased
or the living, and to refrain from eating meat and abusing alcohol. He
adhered to the principle that actions bring consequences.

Shakya Shri's mind was reserved and inscrutable; he did not dwell
on his spiritual development, indicating only that his progression on
the path was manifesting. Below are recounted a few of his experiences
and realizations that he described to some of his older disciples and
others which are found here and there in his writings, that I have neither
exaggerated nor understated.

Shakya Shri manifested clear signs of having developed the prac-
tice of tummo. 146 For example, his clothing and belt would sometimes
catch fire, but then the fire would extinguish itsel£ Moreover, when
he was performing the vajra leap exercise, 147 others would see him,
still seated cross-legged in the lotus position, pause in mid-air before
descending to the ground.

During a second three-year retreat, on the fifteenth day of the third
lunar month of the Metal Snake year (I 88 I), he had the following
expenence.

The white and red vital essences of his body entered the space of
the central channel through the lunar and solar channels. As a result
of that, rabu, the element of bliss above, and ketu, the fire element of
wisdom below, met. Shakya Shri experienced an extraordinary state of
contemplation of the unborn nature of the mind. 148

Following this experience, Shakya Shri was able to foretell the
precise date of the lunar and solar eclipses without resorting to
conventional astronomy. "Such a power:" he said, "is the blessing of my
Master and my wisdom consort"

Once in a vision of clear light he saw a woman with orange eyebrows.
The woman gave him a plate of food resembling rice with vegetables,
saying, "This substance is the offering of the ganachakra of the
dakinis:' Shakya Shri ate the food, leaving no leftovers, and thereby
experienced an uninterrupted realization of the union of emptiness
and bliss which pervaded his body and mind. "This experience;' he
said, "was the result of the kindness of my Master who is inseparable
from Milarepa:'

As an external sign that he had realized the mind's luminous clar-
ity, he saw the sun shining inside his retreat house. During his waking
state he witnessed indescribable magical displays of gods and demons.
However, he exhibited the definitive understanding that demons and
gods in the state of pure awareness are unreal, nothing but the playful
energy of emptiness.

Not long after those experiences, one morning at dawn while
staying in the Long Vajra Cave, also called Secret Treasury of the Da-
kinis, in a manifestation of luminous clarity, he dreamed of meeting
the accomplished master, Lingchen Repa. From him, he received in a
symbolic language numerous introductions to secret teachings. At the
end Lingchen Repa dissolved into Shakya Shri, becoming inseparable
from his pure presence. As this occurred, the knowledge of the state
of reality, beyond any possible definition, dawned in his mind.

Half-way through his three-year retreat, one day at dawn in a
state of luminous clarity, the venerable king of yogins, Milarepa Vajra
Laughter 149 appeared to him three times. Through symbols and sym-
bolic language, Milarepa gave him secret termas containing instruc-
tions of the oral lineage. Upon receiving these teachings, the might of
Shakya Shri's experience and realization expanded beyond any limit.
He himself said, "Through the realization that mind is without root
or source, I attained stability in the nonconceptual realization
of the union of appearance and emptiness:'

It was around this time that, during the day, his state of contemplation
during formal meditation sessions merged as one with his post-meditation
life. At first, he experienced a sense of fear in the dream state, then
he remained without wavering, constantly and exclusively within the sphere
of reality, and suddenly the sense of apprehension disappeared. "This,"
he remarked, "is the result of the kindness of my Master who is of the same nature
as Milarepa:'

One night, he dreamed of meeting Pha Tampa Rinpoche, 150 who
emanated four female knowledge holders 151 from his body, who then
united inseparably with Shakya Shri. While in this union, Pha Tampa
told him:

| By practicing this highest secret path,You will discover total primordial purity
| In the experience of the four joys.
| Emaho!

After this, Shakya Shri, Pha Tampa and the four female knowledge holders dissolved into the inner expanse
of reality within the infinite dimension of luminous clarity. In various dreams he met Labkyi
Dronma (Machig Labdron). 152 In one of those dreams she told him:

| Mind's nature is empty. defying the intellect.
| Any discursive thought which arises in it
| Proceeds to the expanse of luminous clarity and,
| At the end, reaches the inaccessible realm, the unborn.

After saying these words Labkyi Dronma sounded a loud Phat 1s3 and
with that he became inseparable from her in a state of pervasive total
sameness. "Surely this experience comes from the kindness of Khamtrul
Tenpe Nyima:' he said.

Sometimes he heard a distant pleasant music difficult to describe,
which he had never heard before. Of this experience he said, "It
is akin to a sign that indicates the culmination of the training in sound
taught in Dzogchen:'

At times, awake, he had a vision of the two secret cords of Vajrasattva,
extending from his eyes to the center of the sky, like braids of
five-colored light. ''This sign" he said, "resembles those signs revealed
in the Dzogchen tantras:' As a manifestation of wisdom, he had the vision
of a white light, streaming like a white river from his eyes
to the sky, marked by countless thigles of different sizes,
big and small, and so forth. Describing this experience he said,
"This indicates the perfect realization of the power that enables
one to become an awareness holder of spontaneous perfection 154 in the bardo. 155
One night, having gone to urinate, he stayed outside for a long
time. An anxious attendant called out to him, "Please come back in, it's
night-time and pitch dark out there:' He called back, "What is it like,
what you people call darkness?" This is a sign that he was continuously
in an infinite primordial condition, perceiving no difference between
day and night, a state described by Naropa, a previous incarnation
of Shakya Shri, as follows:

| There is no more sun rising nor setting,
| There is no more day and no night.
| Through the words of the Master,
| The dark cloud of concepts has gone.

| I do not conceive of a place to go nor of a place to stay, as
| The citadel of the senses has been conquered by great bliss.
| The inconceivable yoga comes from that.
| Why should I have an object of meditation?

While Shakya Shri was travelling in the regions of southern Tibet, he
arrived in an area in Kongpo, 156 and noticed that people on the bank
of the river Gyamda were about to cross on foot, carrying loads on their
shoulders. Just by wishing to cross to the opposite bank, Shakya Shri
immediately reached the other side. In the same astonishing way he
could instantly reach a mountain facing him. Describing these powers
he remarked, 'These are the signs of realization of the equal taste
of appearance and emptiness:'

In his youth, Shakya Shri learned and practiced the teachings
of the Drugpa Kagyii tradition, and so the main focus of his practicewas
Mahamudra. Later when he met Perna Osal Do Ngag Lingpa (another name
of Jamyang Khyentse Wan gpo), he received teachings
on Dzogchen and from then on he followed a practice that combined
Mahamudra and Dzogchen.

Once in a vision of luminous clarity, he flew into the sky where
he sat cross-legged and naked, and performed other miraculous feats.
Then his body merged inseparably with the sky and he experienced
a boundless, all-pervasive state of contemplation. Through this con-
templation, he attained the highest realization of the great sameness
of samsara and nirvana.

Around that time, as a sign that he had realized the practice of
Vajravarahi, 157 he experienced in an authentic way the three signs of
gathering and the three signs of blazing. 158

On the first day of the lunar month of the Earth Hare year (I 879)
he had a most significant experience. Sleeping lightly, at first he saw a
white light that dissolved into a red light; then the red light dissolved
into a black light; and then the black light dissolved into the black
light of near-culmination. 159 In the ensuing luminous clarity he had a
vision of meeting Khyentse Wangpo who was sitting in a meditation-
box at Dzongsar monastery. Khyentse Wangpo arose and then sat to
the left of the box upon a tiger skin laid on a white mat. As soon as
he sat down, a maiden with large round eyes, her head adorned with
a chunk of amber, appeared in front of him. She was dressed like the
women of Derge. 160 Khyents Rinpoche seemed very pleased to see
the girl and they enjoyed themselves in amorous play.

Shakya Shri thought, "Oh, the spiritual master is doing such
things with that girl!" As soon as he had that thought, the venerable
master Khyentse realized what was transpiring in Shakya Shri's mind
and suddenly said, "What is there to fear or to be attached to in the
application of the skillful means of the mantric path? I will confer the
empowerment on you. Make sure you keep its samayas:' Shakya Shri
made a fervent request with the utmost respect of body, speech and
mind and waited. Khyentse extended his right foot a little and placed
it on the head of Shakya Shri and said, "Now you have received the
initiation of the vase with its corollaries:'161

Then Khyentse took the girl in his lap and in the midst of the
sound of great bliss and light of different colors he entered in union
with her. When skillful means and wisdom parted, 162 Khyentse said,
"Now receive the secret initiation:' As soon as Khyentse spoke, from the
lotus of the young woman descended a stream of the nectar bodhicitta
(or vital essence). Shakya Shri deferentially took the bodhicitta with
his tongue and tasted the pure nectar. His body and mind expanded
with the experience of the supreme great bliss.

The moment Khyentse told him, "Now receive the initiation of
wisdom through knowledge;' Shakya Shri embraced the girl and
entered in union with her. He remained in the state of pure awareness
of immutable bliss and emptiness.

Suddenly Khyentse said:

"All conceptual creations of action, actor and object of action dissolve in the expanse
of the primordial purity beyond concepts. A, Ah!"

Shakya Shri's mind moved beyond thoughts of the experience, he who experiences and that which
is experienced and beyond ordinary meditation which is a result of
mental training. His mind became infinite within the ultimate nature of
supreme primordial pure awareness and emptiness. In this way he received the fourth initiation
of the word. 163

Through an unbroken lineage of pure vision, originating with Vajradhara
and handed down through Indrabhuti 164 and Saraha, until the
omniscient Jamyang Khyentse Wangpo, Shakya Shri received the short
transmission of the three higher initiations which are the quintessence
of the great secret. When Shakya Shri attained supreme realization
through understanding the sense of these initiations, Khyentse Wangpo
spontaneously chanted these vajra words of truth:

| Though I have no power to bless,
| With good intention I bestowed upon you
| The wish to empower your mind.

| Like the relic born from a dog's tooth, 165
| Blessing can be received through faith.
| Other than that, why should you be struck
| Beholding the face of a grubby old man about to die?

| Through the symbol of compassion I have connected you
| To the direct transmission of natural pure awareness.
| May there be auspicious experiences
| And the fUlfillment of the scope of the oral lineage.

Just as Khyentse Wangpo's words indicated, Shakya Shri's realization
of the understanding and experiences resulting from training in the
calm state and in intuitive clarity 166 became like a cloudless sky. This
occurred through his devoted faith, pure mind and the e~powering
energy received from the master. Thus he attained the great certainty
of the immutable realization of the original purity, the unsurpassable
and innermost essence of the teaching of Dzogchen.

For Shakya Shri, most of his objective vision, that energy which
manifests externally, vanished into the expanse of reality. Describing
such realization, Shakya Shri said, "This perfect mastery of the great
expanse, ineffable and transcending all conceptual creations of sam-
sara and nirvana, animate and inanimate exemplified by the idea of
self and other, is the result of the kindness of the all-seeing Master
Khyentse Wangpo:' This statement leaves no doubt that Shakya Shri
actually received the blessing of the state of realization of the mind
of the master.

| In the joyful parks of the seers where immortality is attained,
| Removed from the hustle of many worldly distractions,
| You have practiced alone, like a powerful one-horned rhinoceros
| Traversing an infinite array of valleys where medicinal herbs grow.
| You have transcended the style of worldly teachers
| With their high-sounding names devoid of meaning,

| Who, unconscientious and distracted by laziness,
| Confuse others and busy themselves with projects.
| Wearing the challenging armor of unbreakable courage
| Which cannot be pierced by the weapon of sudden obstacles,
| And with the hook of sharp faculties and steady perseverance,
| You have secured goodness, qualities and glory.
| Having seen directly the form of the indestructible and indivisible
| Natural state, innate, unfettered by thoughts,
| The pure awareness of luminous clarity,
| You have mastered the great siddhi of supreme boundless realization.
| Flying with the fully spread wings of method and wisdom,
| You are the bird of total presence soaring over the precipice of the eight paths; 167
| Moving effortlessly in the sky of absolute sameness,
| You spontaneously self-liberate from the vicious trap of effort.
| With the conduct that, among all tantric methods of enhancement,
| Is the nearest cause for awakening,
| You joyously play with incantation-born and field-born dakinis 168
| Who have entered the gateway, symbol of the unborn.
| In particular, from the precious wish-fulfilling vase from the treasury of Khyentse,
| Source of the dance of transformations, unobstructed magical display of forms

| Of the Teacher Samantabhadra, the primordial savior,
| You drank the nectar of the teaching of the direct transmission,
| The highest wisdom, the realization of the essential nature of the ineffable mind.
| You have directly realized the limitless vast expanse,
| The sphere which is free from the sharp edge of concepts,
| The tenet beyond the eight vehicles, the excellent path travelled by all buddhas.
| You have reached the sublime level of the throne of victorious Siddhartha, 169
| The (bodhisattva in his) last existence, and received the supreme prophecy, 170
| The encouragement of the deities of the mandala of the victorious ones
| That are the energy of pure awareness.
| You have gained magical powers, much desired by others,
| And irresistibly captivate the minds of all beings and deities.
| You whose acts eclipse the deluded of our times who pretend to be realized beings,
| You are a wondrous vision, shining in the realms of samsara and nirvana.

On one occasion, when Shakya Shri was living in a tent made of black
yak hair, he had a vision of the enlightened Longchenpa, 171 the supreme
deity. Then, in a manifestation of the mind's luminous clarity, he met
the wisdom body of the great omniscient Longchenpa, from whom he
received the blessing of the three secrets (body, speech and mind). With
such blessing came the certainty of having untied the knot of many
essential points of the profound instructions. Thereafter, knowledge
of the scriptures' entire meaning, born from meditation, burst forth
from the depth of his being. The scriptures are those exemplified in
The Seven Precious Treasuries by Longchenpa, who was like the Buddha
himself illuminating the sense of the profound treasury of the entire
canon of the Realized One. This knowiedge arose in Shakya Shri
without study or reflection.

One time, when his disciple Tashi Lhadar was explaining the results
of his practice to Shakya Shri, the Master was greatly pleased
and said, "You are returning a gift to me!". That night, the light of
the butter-lamp facing Shakya Shri illuminated clearly the wall behind
his shoulders as if he were transparent. Although they sat for a long
time talking, whenever the flame of the butter-lamp was about to die
out, it would start to blaze again brightly.

In the sunlight, if one would look for the shadow cast by his
hands or arms, one could see it only pale and shimmering. He did not
have the typical darkish shadow of an ordinary person. On the palm
of his left hand was a peculiar growth of flesh that clearly resembled
the letter A. In his later years, he developed an atypical small tooth
with the clear mark of the letter A. This tooth is preserved among his
relics. 172 He would exhibit physical transformations that no one could
really understand. At times his body appeared to be very old, at other
times quite the contrary with his body so young and radiant that one
could not help staring at him.

Shakya Shri had gone totally beyond any idea of rejecting or ac-
cepting. Yet, the power of his knowledge of the relative things of the
world blossomed without limitation. Due to such a power, all places
and regions in the world would appear to him, dear and unobstructed,
in the expanse of his mind.

He had continuous and wondrous prescience. For instance, he
would see the hidden lands of Pemako, 173 the Khenpa valley, 174 and
Sikkim, 175 among other areas, with their precise geographic character-
istics. Sometimes, &om wherever he was standing, he was able to see in
dear detail the figures of travellers walking on the facing mountain.
Although he had all the outer, inner and secret signs of having
travelled the inner path, he kept his good qualities to himself, like a
gem hidden on the ocean floor. Such is the supreme behavior of a
realized being. His attainment of perfect confidence in the state of
self-liberation (after he gained realization itself) is not something that
ordinary people could understand. It is even difficult for sbravakas and
pratyekabuddbas176 to comprehend.

In between meditation sessions, he would peruse scriptures whose
subject dealt with the ultimate meaning. At the same time, he would
remain in a state of pure awareness utterly free &om concepts and activi-
ties. The actions of his three secrets, body, speech and mind, remained
uniquely within the single state of contemplation. Even the way he sat
was unlike other people, and if viewed by anyone with discrimination,
that alone was sufficient to cause pure faith to arise. He was free of
the flaw of self-deception.

Though he lived as an ordinary human, his mind encompassed
in perfect sameness Samantabhadra, the primordial savior. Because of
the powerful flow of his compassion which dominated samsara and
nirvana, he could gather around himself people &om any region or
village and all kinds of disciples, with advanced, average and lower
capacities. As he could dominate appearances, he was overwhelming,
and whatever he said was held valid. He had the power to turn different kinds
of disciples toward the teaching. In those who established a
connection with him, and whomever else he met, he planted the seed
of liberation.

| First you mastered learning, reflection and meditation,
| Midway you raised the victory banner of the highest practice,
| In the end you attained the state of immutable realization.
| You have gained the heights,
| The two accomplishments of the Diamond Way, m
| The highest indestructible Way, superior to all paths;
| Your noble mind, beyond the reach of ordinary people,
| Is the supreme mind of the teacher Samantabhadra.
| The power of excellent experiences having been perfected,
| You ascended the throne of highest realization.
| The magnetizing light of your positive deeds radiates to deeply devoted and gifted disciples.
| You are replete with countless splendid qualities and
| A halo of bountiful auspiciousness surrounds you.
| Causing joy and well-being to manifest, you created supreme fortune in the three worlds.
| You are a sacred being praised by the buddhas and bodhi- sattvas.
| The liberation story of such a glorious Master, like the immensity of a great ocean,
| Is beyond the comprehension of ordinary beings, who are like frogs in a well.
| You have attained the jewel-pinnacle of the glorious mansion of knowledge,
| The white flag of unequalled charismatic deeds that have accomplished the two objectives, 178
| And the brilliant victory banner of courage, impervious to powerful enemies and demons.
| Without summoning, all the goodness of this world and beyond come to you as guests.
| Here from the lotus flower of the three types of faith,179
| Like the pollen enjoyed by bees,
| I have revealed for disciples just a fragment
| Of the master's life-story of liberation.

CHAPTER V. His Life Dedicated to Practice, He Receives Blessings and Siddhis, Such as Visions of Masters and Deities and the Discovery of Profound Termas

SOME OF SHAKY A SHRI's visions of deities and masters, and vari-
ous other experiences have already been recounted. At times these
signs, indicating that he had reached an optimal level in a particular
practice, heralded peculiar challenging experiences. For example, when
in retreat in one of the Chugoshog caves of Drugu, he experienced
the cave turning upside down, with the floor on top and the ceiling at
the bottom and all the grit and rubble falling down on him. Another
time, the mouth of the cave dosed and for a long time he stayed in
total darkness. Nonetheless, Shakya Shri remained absorbed in a state
of contemplation beyond hope and fear, further enhancing his state
of realization; after a few days the dimensions and shape of the cave
returned to normal.

When Shakya Shri spent three years in retreat at the hermitage of
Lhadrag Perna Yangdzong practicing The Mind Essence of Samantabhadra,
as an outer sign of his accomplishments the offering of medicine and
blood 180 began to boil, and as an inner sign, an extraordinary knowledge
was born in his mind.

Around that time, when an official called Wangden went to pay
him a visit, Shakya Shri emanated in the form of a tiger at the entrance
of the cave. Seeing the tiger, the man was terrified. He dropped the
curd, grains and other food he was carrying as offerings for the Master
and fled to a safe distance. He looked back, but he could no longer see the tiger.
With some trepidation he returned to the cave and saw Shakya Shri at rest there, smiling,
"Why are you afraid of such a small
thing? I came to greet you. But make sure not to tell anyone else what
happened:' When Shakya Shri was practicing alone in the wilderness, a
snow leopard visited him several times. Like a pet dog, it would wander
around nearby and then lie down next to him. Then in the morning it
would return to the mountains.

Going from his hermitage of Solder on pilgrimage to the mountain of
Khawa Karpo, 181 he saw appear a beautiful white vulture that was the manifestation
of a dakini. The vulture walked alongside Shakya
Shri through three mountain passes. Then at Doke pass the people
accompanying him felt the earth tremble, and saw rainbows forming
and snow falling profUsely in the shape of beautiful four-petalled flow-
ers of different colors: white, yellow, red and blue. Those with pure
karma saw the Master appear in the sky in the midst of the rainbows.
After crossing the pass, while travelling along the road on the same
pilgrimage, all those present could see a circular rainbow light with
three rings directly above Shakya Shri's head.

Over the entire time they were travelling, at each place they wit-
nessed amazing signs such as these rainbow formations and a circular
rainbow resembling a canopy or parasol above Shakya Shri. As they
were coming up from Tagra in the region of Trayab, a voice resounded
in the sky, "The reincarnation ofTrayab Kyabgon Rinpoche has been
born near this river:' Shakya Shri remarked to Gyurme and some other
disciples, "It seems that the reincarnation of this master has taken
birth:' The prophetic words turned out to be true and the reincarna-
tion of the lama was found in that area.

On another occasion, Shakya Shri went to pay a visit to Phagchen
Rinpoche of Chamdo 182 who was returning from Lhasa. On the way
back to his hermitage Shakya Shri and his attendants had to spend the
night at Dibon monastery. That night he suddenly fell ill with symp-
toms of high blood pressure. 183 Caught by surprise, his attendants were
at a loss as to what to do. However, by 'the next day, the symptoms had
disappeared and he was feeling normal again. He told his attendant
Tsondrii Gyurme, "Last night five types of gyalpo 184 present here were
derisive, and caused me some problems. Nonetheless, because
of my understanding of emptiness, they could not really create any obstacles.
I overpowered them with my contemplation and bound them under
oath:' 185

Sometime before, when Phagpa Rinpoche of Chamdo, Dahen
Kalzang 186 and others were building a splendid new temple for the
purpose of housing a Maitreya 187 statue, the building collapsed three
or four times. Gyatrul Rinpoche 188 had a vision in which he saw a
length of coarse felt of black yak hair blowing in the wind on top
ofDilsum mountain while the temple collapsed.

Gyatrul Rinpoche said, "It is the magical display of some perverse demon.
The situation can only be solved by inviting a realized and powerful master:"
The important Dahen sent a monk to invite Shakya Shri.
That monk thought, "If Phagchen Rinpoche and his spiritual heirs
aren't able to subjugate the interfering demon, then how can that lazy
old fellow do it?" When he arrived in the presence of Shakya Shri, the
Master, having read the monk's mind said, "Oh, if the Protector (that
is, Phagchen Rinpoche) and his heirs can't do anything in this situation,
what can a lazy old fellow like me do?" His hidden thought exposed,
the monk realized Shakya Shri's power, and developed boundless faith
in him. He then invited the Master properly, and Shakya Shri came
to Chamdo. Merely by performing the fierce concentration of issuing
commands and expelling interferences, he overcame the obstacles that
had prevented the temple construction, and the signs of disturbance
immediately subsided.

The following year, when the huge statue of Maitreya was being
built, parts of the statue completed during the day would collapse at
night. Some of the sculptors also died. When the construction of the
statue had almost been renounced, Shakya Shri was invited, as before,
to resolve the impasse. For seven days the Master practiced the rite
of hurling the tormas, united with the practice of dark blue Guru
Tragpo. Then he performed the ritual of consecrating the statue in
connection with various deities. All obstacles ceased and the erecting
of the statue could be completed, to the satisfaction and delight of
the lamas and overseers.

In the same miraculous way, a source of water sprang up at the
hermitage of Solder. No matter how much they drew, the water was
sufficient for all the local people. At times its color became as white
as milk. This marvelous spring is still there today.

Later on Shakya Shri stayed in retreat, engaging in the practice of
Kilaya Yangsang Putri. 189 He had a vision of the glorious Vajrakilaya
who conferred upon him the ability to perform magical feats of power
and strength. Thus he was victorious over all demonic forces and in-
terferences. Shakya Shri exhibited such powers when the forest at the
base of the mountain facing his retreat place caught fire. He extended
his hand in the threatening mudra 190 and instantly the fire went out.
On another occasion a magical display of demonic forces provoked a
violent storm that was extremely unusual for the season, causing a huge
landslide. He took the phurba191 attached to the belt around his waist
and gestured with it, causing the storm to subside and the landslide
to reverse its course.

Shakya Shri convinced many hunters such as Khang Mardopa of
Trayab and others to vow to abstain from killing. Each hunter gave
his knife to Shakya Shri and begged him to knot the weapon thus
transforming it into an object that inspires faith. Shakya Shri blew on
the weapons and enjoined some of his disciples, "Knot them!" In ac-
cordance with the hunters' wishes, the knives became knotted. Later in
the day a hunter came with his knife wishing to ask Shakya Shri to knot
it. The Master had already entered his daily session of formal practice,
and thus one of his disciples called Shingkyong, who did not want to
interrupt him, knotted the knife himself This actually happened.

At a certain point, Shakya Shri wrote several letters to Tondrub,
the overseer of Aghe monastery in Trayab, warning him that he would
be facing serious trouble. Soon after, Tondrub was cast into a Chinese-
Tibetan prison, in danger of execution. An unshakable faith in Shakya
Shri arose in him and he made an earnest plea for help to Shakya Shri.
Following that, he was released from prison. Tondrub became a dis-
ciple of the Master and his mind attained full liberation through his
practice of the teachings. At his death, many bone relics were found
after his cremation. The Gelug master Changmon and others greatly
praised Tondrub for his outstanding realization.

At the age of thirty-seven Shakya Shri travelled to Lhasa. There
he camped on the shore of Artsa lake. 192 One day as he sat in contem-
plation he said, "A perverse and malevolent local guardian is
planning to strike us from above with lightning:' The Master performed the
serkyem 193 and when he rotated between his palms the phurba which
he carried on his belt, pointing it toward the sky, the signs indicating
imminent danger subsided. Then the Master bound the local guardian
under oath. When Shakya Shri visited Ganden monastery, 194 he prayed in
front of the statue of Lobzang Tragpa (blo bzanggrags pa, Je Tsongkhapa),
the monastery's founder. Signs of his realization were exhibited to
those present when the white scar£ signifying respect, thrown by him
towards the statue remained suspended in space for some time before
reaching it.

Shakya Shri then travelled to Samyeling. 195 The guardian Gyalpo
Pehar 196 was there with his entourage. Wishing to assess the level
of Shakya Shri's realization, the guardian repeatedly opened the bolt that
closed the door to the room where the Master was staying, and at-
tempted to compete with him by manifesting various magical displays.
Shakya Shri remained unperturbed and brought Pehar and his entourage
under control through the force of his contemplation.

On another occasion Shakya Shri was circumambulating the
mountain of Tsari, taking the intermediate route. At the boulder
known as Basin of Offerings for the Ganachakra of the Dakinis, 197
he performed a ganachakra during which time many remarkable signs
manifested: rainbows appeared in the sky shaped like the eight aus-
picious symbols; a fine drizzle gave the ground a shiny glaze; 198 and
music resembling the sound of conch shells and ritual trumpets was
heard at length.

When he arrived in Pempa in the region of Lhodrag, he was
holding in his hands a black stone that was an inner symbol of the
stupa199 dedicated to Vajrapani 200 found in that place. This black stone
had a self-arisen white A emerging from it. Shakya Shri looked at it
carefully and then he placed it over his head as a sign of respect. As
he did so, nectar flowed from the stone. Those present could see and
taste the nectar and believed the stone to be highly sacred.

Together with a few disciples, the Master in the guise of a beg-
gar or wandering yogin 201 went on pilgrimage to Lapchi, 202 and to
central and western Tibet. While staying at the fort of Gyantse, he
had a vision of the local guardian Tashi Tseringma203 with a host of
dakinis coming to welcome him. Another time his travel companions
saw Shakya Shri's body enveloped in rainbows, which some thought
might be an indication that the Master would die soon. When a dose
attendant heard this, he asked the Master the meaning of the appear-
ance of these rainbows. Shakya Shri explained that while other peoE.k
were seeing rainbows, he dearly saw the face of Guru Rinpoche, the
king and his subjects. 204

Then the Master travelled to Sakya. 205 Near the town, the magic
of a 'blazing female spirit' 206 created a tempest that caused a violent
rain of small pebbles to fall everywhere. Shakya Shri overpowered the
spirit with diamond-like contemplation so that no one present, Master
or disciple, was injured and the disturbance subsided.
When they were dose to the Lapchi mountain, another fierce
storm arose, and from its midst seven wild asses circled the Master
clockwise three times. Later, when they had passed by, the Master told
his disciples that again he had had the vision of Tseringma and her
four sisters welcoming him.

Arriving at Lapchi, they visited the monastery of Nyama Dzong.
This monastery marks the spot where Milarepa, having sent Rechungpa
(one of his heart-disciples) to fetch water, set fire to all the scriptures
containing black magic incantations that Rechungpa had brought back
from India. To distract Rechungpa while he was burning the books, he
created a magical display of wild asses and wolves cavorting together.
When all the scriptures were burned, Milarepa dissolved the display
into a black stone and on it a white 'X of calcite appeared spontaneously.

This stone was among the sacred objects of the monastery. As
soon as Shakya Shri took that stone into his hands, shining dewdrops
formed on it. The people who were with him tasted the nectar of
these drops. The monastery's monks and teachers remarked that they had
heard of the stone producing nectar, but until that day they themselves
had never witnessed this miracle. "Milarepa in flesh and blood has
arrived here;' they said of Shakya Shri, and they were filled with great
faith and devotion toward the Master.

Then Shakya Shri asked the monks of the monastery, "Do you see the form of
Amitayus207 on the rocks over there?" They replied, "We can't
see anything like that:' The Master pointed his finger towards a
specific spot on the rocks, revealing to them the spontaneously arisen
form of Amitayus. In this way they were all able to discern the form
of Amitayus from whose heart long-life water trickled. The Master
told Sotse, a dose attendant, to scrape away a little earth from that
spot. Without hesitating, the man scratched the earth away, and the
wondrous nectar flowed copiously. Shakya Shri gave some of this nectar
to Jamyang Tulku ofTrayab monastery, and it is still there among the
sacred objects belonging to the incarnate lama.

For one and a half months the Togden remained in retreat in the
Crystal Cave of Reed Fortress. 208 While he was empowering the me-
dicinal elixir, 209 nectar poured like melted butter from the front of the
torma dedicated to the deity, filling the plate on which the torma had
been placed. The nectar, overflowing the plate, spilled on the wooden
plank where the offerings were arranged, staining some scriptures.
The scriptures were placed in the sun and next to the fire so that they
could dry, and the oily stains faded away completely, without leaving
any trace. Moreover, everyone saw nectar brimming over the skull-cup
containing the medicinal substances the master was empowering. Many
wondrous signs like these occurred.

In this magical atmosphere Shakya Shri proceeded on his pilgrim-
age through Nyalam, 210 eventually arriving in Lhasa unobtrusively, so
that nobody would notice his presence. However, on the road, without
attendants being aware of her, a hideous old woman came up to the
Master and offered him two self-arisen gold nuggets the size of two
thumbs, saying, "With these, paint the whole body of the statue of
Jowo Buddha in the temple of Lhasa:' 2ll

When Shakya Shri asked permission from government officials
in Lhasa to apply gold paint to the Jowo Buddha, he showed them
the spontaneously arisen nuggets. The officials exclaimed, "These are
superb! Where do they come from?" Then they granted permission,
saying, "You may apply this powdered gold" giving him an equal
amount of gold powder, and keeping the nuggets.

The gold was applied over the entire buddha statue and at the
same time the one thousand offering rite212 was performed. The re-
maining gold was used to paint the faces of all the statues in the upper
chambers of the temple; there was enough paint to do them all, bar
none. The liquid gold seemed to be inexhaustible. When Tashi Lha-
dar, a disciple of Shakya Shri, touched the feet of the Jowo Buddha
as a sign of respect in order to receive its blessing, wet gold stuck to
his forehead. Seeing this, an old custodian of the temple said, "This
time everything is covered in gold, people as well as statues:' All were
astounded and felt deep reverence for the Master.

Shakya Shri himself sat in front of Jowo Buddha offering the rite
of bathing2 13 and of consecration for the sake of the doctrine and all
sentient beings. He invoked the power of truth, and prayed for the
welfare of the teachings and of sentient beings.

While in Lhasa, he fulfilled the wishes of all, including those
who beseeched him for long life initiations. At that time he also gave
the initiation, transmission and detailed teachings on Vajravarahi to
Dharma Sahu (the Newari Sahu Dharmamanasim Tuladhar), a Nepal-
ese disciple, and told him to do the practice in solitary retreat. While in
retreat, Dharma Sahu had a vision of that deity several times during his
practice. Sakya Shri thus freed the minds of many disciples by giving
them the ripening initiation and profound liberating instructions.

Later, the Master stayed at Denbag below Drepung monastery. 214
Two geshel- 15 from Hardong, 216 the location of Gomang college at
Drepung monastery, announced that they wished to challenge Shakya
Shri to a philosophical debate. With that intention in mind, they ar-
rived where the Master was staying. Shakya Shri's attendants were a bit
apprehensive, but the Master reassured them, saying, "You don't have
anything to fear:' He told the two geshes to rely on the meaning rather
than on words and conferred at length with them. The two monks felt
humble, and great confidence and faith in the Master arose in them.
Their eyes filling with tears, they prostrated respectfully to Shakya Shri.
The Master then gave them the profound teachings. Afterwards they
searched for a suitable place and stayed in solitary retreat. By applying
themselves one-pointedly to their practice, the two became famous as
practitioners who were able to benefit others.

Another time, at his retreat place of Solder in the Dru mountains,
Shakya Shri performed the empowerment of the medicinal elixir through a
Rite of Chakrasamvara Indivisible from the Master. During
the practice, everyone around could hear a melodious 'ting ting' sound
coming from above the mandala; 217 it had never been heard before and
lasted a long time. The fragrance of the medicinal ingredients
was also exquisite, and permeated the atmosphere. The butter-lamp in front
of the mandala lit itself spontaneously and blazed with radiance. At one
point in the empowerment of the medicinal elixir, Shakya Shri had the repeated vision
of the Great Compassionate Kasarpani, 218 twice the height of
a normal human being, standing on the spot of the socalled palace (container)
of the medicinal elixir. On the lower half of his body he was wearing the skin
of a snake with its head turned to his
right side and the tail to his left. His right hand was in the mudra of
the supreme gift, 219 and the left was holding a vase at the heart. Drops
of nectar continuously flowed along the incantation cord (going from
the heart of the Master to the medicinal ingredients). 220

At the age of forty-six Shakya Shri began a three-year retreat in
a small house that had been newly built for him. Quite suddenly he
became sick with what seemed to be a fever. Gyalpo Pehar (manifest-
ing sometimes as the gyalpo of the body, other times as the gyalpo of
the mind) displayed magical events for about a month, searching
for the Master's weak point. Shakya Shri remained in an unperturbed
state and spontaneously recovered from his illness. Another time, the
Master was harassed by a spirit living in the region ofTrayab, who also
tested his vulnerability. When the first signs of this obstacle manifested,
Shakya Shri stayed in retreat, flawlessly practicing Guru Tragpo. From
that time on, his power became so strong that no kind of interference
could approach him

When Shakya Shri was about forty-seven, Adzom Drugpa
Rinpoche said, "This will be a difficult year for Togden Rinpoche:'
He told Ogyen Tendzin, one of his disciples, to travel day and night
without stopping and deliver a letter to Shakya Shri. Ogyen Tendzin
arrived in nine days and handed the communication to Shakya Shri.
When the messenger arrived, the precious king of the yogins did not
have any physical sign of illness, although he had been having trouble-
some visions. He saw a disembodied hand seizing and dismembering
him. Sometimes he felt hurled into the mouth of a being with a huge
head, feeling its hot breath.

Shakya Shri said, "Though I did not ask Adzom Drugpa for this
letter, its contents are to the point. We must immediately perform
the necessary rituals;' and he arranged for them to be done. All the
troubling signs were transformed, and for several days Shakya Shri
experienced his environment as the buddhafield of Akanishtha. 221 He
had visions of Samantabhadra, of the buddhas of the five families, 222
of Tara, and so on, as well as signs indicating that he had become free
&om interfering forces. Adzom Drugpa also performed the fire rite 223
for the sake of gaining a long life for Shakya Shri. At that time, in the
sky above the platform of fire, a rainbow appeared, and in its midst
Adzom Drugpa saw Shakya Shri with a radiant white body. He said
with full conviction, "This practice has been effective. For the time
being he will have no problems for his health and life:' In fact, the
Master had no further problems.

Shakya Shri on one occasion visited Jamgon Kongtrul, whose
presence was exactly like that ofVairochana. 224 Kongtrul gave him relics
saying, "These are mother relics, but so far they have not multiplied.225
I'll leave them with you. Keep them next to your body and perform
the bathing purification ritual accompanied by prayers and so forth:'

Shakya Shri kept the relics next to his body as he was told, and one day
the mother relics produced many small ones. When he offered them
back, he told Kongtrul, "These relics have multiplied, not because I
have a great power of compassion, but as an interdependent connection
between my having many children and the power of your intention:'
One day Kongtrul showed Shakya Shri the terma objects he had
discovered. Among them was a treasure box containing a highly sacred
statue of Shri Simha. 226 As Shakya Shri neared the statue an incredible
thing occurred: wherever Shakya Shri moved, the statue would turn
to face him.

When Adzom Drugpa fell ill and his body felt extremely heavy,
Shakya Shri was sent for. On his way, he had to pass a place called
Tagchen Sumra, where he recited auspicious verses and prayers of as-
piration for the long life of the three secrets (body, speech and mind)
of Adzom Drugpa. Then Shakya Shri said, "Now there will be no
problem for the precious Master's life and health. He will definitely
recover from his illness soon:' In fact, by the time he arrived at the
residence of Adzom Drugpa, the lama was already feeling better and
no longer needed rites performed. Extremely pleased to see Shakya
Shri, Adzom Drugpa said, "Oh, Vajradhara in person has come. No
one can match him!"

Another time when Adzom Drugpa was not feeling well, he said,
"This year I've often been ill:' And he wrote to Shakya Shri, asking
that he perform a divination, since "no one is better than the Togden
of Drugu monastery for performing accurate divinations:' The Master
Shakya Shri did this, and sent his disciple Tseten Dorje to deliver the
results. Tseten took five days to reach Adzom Drugpa's residence. While
the disciple was on his way, Shakya Shri prayed for. the long life of
Adzom Drugpa, and by the time the messenger arrived Adzom Drugpa
had already recovered from his illness and needed no further rituals.

When Shakya Shri went to meet Mipham Rinpoche at Ngag
Lhong Nang, 227 it began to rain heavily. Neither Shakya Shri nor his
clothes became wet, and the people there were astonished.
The Master said, "Don't mind the rain. It is like an offering of tea: this
is how the deities favor those who keep the five precepts:' 228

On the way back, when he and his companions arrived at
Yulkhar, 229 the whole valley was covered with white clouds. The sun
had just risen, shining through the clouds warmly. Just above Shakya
Shri's head a circular rainbow appeared, and his body was enveloped
in rainbow light. No matter what he did, walking or sitting, wondrous
events like this happened, and lasted a long time. Dechen Chogdrub,
one of his close attendants whose job was looking after the horses,
asked the Master what that meant; Shakya Shri replied, "The same
things happened at Doke pass, while we were on our way to the sacred
place of Khawa Karpo mountain:' He would not say whether these
were good or bad signs.

When an old lama of Kutse monastery died, Shakya Shri's son
Rinchen Kunden kept asking the Master where his reincarnation would
appear, but he did not answer and just kept silent. Shakya Shri later said
to Acho, his secret consort, "The old lama is now in your womb:'
Many incarnations such as Ngagdra Tulku of Char, 230 Sonying Tulku of
Drugu monastery, the tulku of the old lama of Kutse and
others, appeared clearly in the mirror of the Master's wisdom. Shakya
Shri's indications regarding their incarnations agreed with those made
by Drugpa Yongdzin and other masters; and the tulkus were enthroned
accordingly. His ability to recognize reincarnations further increased
his disciples' confidence and faith in him, as well as that of the local pwple.

Shakya Shri always gave out Kashmiri saffron as a cure 231 for the sick, regardless
of their specific ailment. After people had taken it a few times,
it functioned as 'the single medicine that cures a hundred
diseases: His remedies were effective and capable of curing even those
amicted by serious diseases. When, through his pure perception, Shakya
Shri could see that a sick person was destined to die, he would give him
or her sacred substances or a relic of an enlightened being, treating all
l'l)ually without regard to social status.

In the Earth Bird year (1909), the Master made a pilgrimage to the
power place ofTsari. In the first lunar month of that year, his journeyin
the region ofTagpo 232 was interrupted for more than two days by a
heavy snowfall on Sholar Gang mountain. He performed the serkyem
rite addressed to the guardians, and then easily proceeded on his way
without encountering any further difficulties, contrary to everyone's
expectations. The local people of that region as well as the travellers
present could hardly believe the event they had witnessed.

In Tsari Chigchar 33 he gave instructions on Mahamudra and
Dzogchen, the Six Yogas of Naropa, and so forth, to more than a
thousand people who had requested his teaching. The Master visited
the monastery of Perna Karpo 234 in Char and there paid homage to a
statue of Kunpang Gyumai Karkhen, 235 renowned for bestowing bless-
ings. This statue, made by Perna Karpo's own hands, just before Shakya
Shri's arrival, grew a head of hair and a mustache. This was taken as a
certain sign that Shakya Shri was an emanation of the great Kunpang,
and as a sign that his spreading of the dharma would flourish.

When he performed the empowerment of medicinal elixir in
Tsari, the fragrance of the medicinal herbs permeated the air; beautiful
white clouds appeared in the sky along with myriad rainbows. These
auspicious signs were seeds which blossomed into faith, the hundred-
petalled flower, in his disciples' minds.

On the way back from Tsari, the Master was nearing the crest of
Sharkong mountain when he had a vision of the Chamdo guardian
Shang Pedab with his retinue, and of the local spirit Lhadrag Karpo
coming to welcome him. No one else could see them, but people did
hear the sounds of big and small bells ringing all around them, and
they noticed two ravens cawing in diverse manners while circling in
the air above the mountain peak. The ravens then made a clockwise
circumambulation three times above Shakya Shri, and flew away to-
wards the east.

There is clear evidence that the Master in one of his former lives
took birth as Denma, the cherished minister of King Lingje Gesar, 236
but here this is of little relevance, and I will not dwell on that.

When Shakya Shri read the biography of Nyagre Sewo, 237 the
Master stated that he was an incarnation of that great adept.

Once he said, "When I visited the Densathil monasterf 38 of
Phagmo Trupa ,239 I clearly remembered my previous life as Lingrepa, 240
and that I had attained realization after drinking a skull-cup filled with

Fighting between China and Tibet broke out in the Year of
the Iron Dog (I9IO) and the Master and his sons went to Lhadrag
Yangdzong. Near the caves where the monks lived, people heard a
horse neighini 41 again and again. Everyone began to shake with fear,
their hair bristling in terror. Shakya Shri said, "The guardians of the
teachings are welcoming me back to Lhadrag:'

The Master had received a prediction that in that place there was
a hidden treasure to be found, a statue of Guru Padmasambhava as
well as two phurbas with three-sided blades. He attempted to find it,
but the right time to unearth the terma had not yet arrived. It would
not have been beneficial for beings, and so the Master could not do
so. One day Shakya Shri told a dose disciple that in one of his visions
he had seen the head lama of Trayab monastery with his entourage
travelling far away, and said, "I wonder what that means?" Later, the
Chinese army inflicted harm in the region ofTrayab, causing the lama
and his disciples to flee to the Kailash242 region and to Nepal.

While Gyatrul Rinpoche was staying at Siwalung in Drugu on the
way back from teaching his disciples in Beru, he told Shakya Shri's son
TseW:mg of a vision he had had. He had seen the religious and social
life of the Chamdo region reduced to a heap of dust. "Therefore;' he
advised, "the head lama of Chamdo and his heir should keep this in
mind, and perform without fail the appropriate rites for the situation:'
Some of the monk attendants did not believe the lama's warning, and
laughed. This was well before any evidence of troubles with the Chinese.
Later Gyatrul Rinpoche's predictions came true, and also Champaling
monasterf43 in Chamdo went through bad times.

Phin Thang Ling, the Chinese governor of Chamdo, among other
officials of the Chinese army, often came to Drugu monastery. The
disciples of the Master were frightened and hid what they could in
the mountains nearby.

"No matter what we do to save ourselves;' they said to Shakya
Shri, "here, too, the Chinese will certainly burn everything down, as
they did in Chamdo:' Togden Rinpoche, who was well aware of the
situation, sent a modest disciple with a religiously-oriented letter ex-
plaining to the Chinese officials that it was not appropriate to harm
the hermitage for it was very poor and simple, nor would it be right to
harm the fauna, the birds, the deer and other animals on the mountain
where the hermitage was situated. The letter also explained the great
benefits of not doing such harm.

On various occasions, important as well as lesser Chinese officials
noted that the practitioners at Shakya Shri's hermitage seemed authentic
and ingenuous. In China, too, on the Mountain of the Five Peaks,244
they had similar hermitages. There, they had promised not to harm
the monastery and hermitage of the teacher Dza Ogyen.245

Later, the Chinese army camped for a long time near Drugu mon-
astery, and in Ngadrug Satsugkha officials and soldiers occasionally
went to Shakya Shri's hermitage. They would carefully and repeatedly
search everywhere, all over the big and small buildings. Apart from that
scrutiny, they did not inspect the temple housing the three representa-
tions (of the enlightened Body, Voice and Mind), and its surrounding
area. They did not even ask questions. It seemed as if they had been
blindfolded and could not see the temple. When Chinese soldiers
ventured near the hermitage of the monastery to hunt deer, they were
immediately pelted by a violent hailstorm which scared the men off,
and they quickly headed back to camp. From that day on, the deer on
the Drugu mountains lived in peace and without fear.

Shakya Shri knew that the regions of eastern Tibet would encoun-
ter difficult times, and so for days, he, his sons and his main disciples
did rites several times in each twenty-four hour period, to avert danger.
They also performed ganachakras, and so on. All this they did with the
pure intention of preserving the general and specific Buddhist teach-
ings in Trayab and Chamdo, and of helping the central government's
religious and secular activities. Wondrous signs and omens appeared
indicating the resolution of problems and also the increase of prosper-
ity. In the latter part of his life Shakya Shri went to the region ofTsari
and stayed near Happy Cave. 246 The protector Chokyi Wangpo (the
tenth Drugchen Rinpoche) completed the construction of a house for
the lama, a new temple, and statues of the eighty-four mahasiddhas 247
and so on, in the upper part of the Drugpa Kagyii monastery of Sang
Ngag Choling; he then invited Shakya Shri, a son and his entourage
for the consecration ceremony.

For one week the rite of consecration of the temple was performed with the monks of
the monastery and others. During the rituals the earth trembled, odd sounds were heard, and there
was a rain of Bowers. On that occasion, Shakya Shri had an experience
of pure perception and told his dose disciples, "A sign has occurred that the statue
of one of the siddhas in front of you has received a special blessing:' People
looked at the statues and saw that one statue had become radiant and
had moved its leg slightly, as if preparing to stand up. All those present
witnessed this and other extraordinary clear signs.
The statue of the 'mahasiddha with a bent leg' still exists in that temple. 248

Another extraordinary event also happened at that time: a fire
broke out at the base of the mountain near the Happy Cave hermit-
age, and people worried that the fire could be devastating. Shakya Shri
came to the door of his room. He took out the three-sided dagger
he kept at his neck, focused his concentration and gestured with the
dagger. Suddenly a violent storm arose, which buffeted the fire until
it was extinguished. During the waxing phase of the first lunar month
of the Earth Horse year (I9I8), while the restoration project at
Swayambhu stupa in Nepal249 was in progress, one night Shakya Shri
had a vision of a beautiful girl dressed in special garb and adorned
with gold ornaments. She said to the Master, "The restoration of
the stupa is nearly completed. I have supported the works as much as
I could, creating favorable conditions:' Then she vanished. Another
night, the great guardian Rahula250 manifested to the Master as an old
monk with a coral-red face. He appeared in front of the Master and
said, "I have fUlfilled the promise to work for the restoration of the
stupa;' and then disappeared in the ultimate nature of pure awareness.
When the restoration of Swayambhu stupa, one of the most sacred
representations on this earth, was completed, the day of preparation
for the consecration rite arrived.

As the Master from his retreat place in Tibet focused his mind in
order to dispel any obstacles, a violent storm was sweeping through the
Kathmandu valley and throughout all of Nepal. However, on the day
of the actual consecration, the weather became very mild. When the
ceremonies ended on the fifteenth day of the lunar month, the same
husked barley, rice and saffron-scented water that Shakya Shri had
scattered in the air at Happy Cave in Tsari, fell upon the Swayambhu
stupa in Nepal.

I have recorded here only a few of the wondrous signs indicating
that Shakya Shri possessed great powers and clairvoyance. I have not
described the signs that were always present (a few of which I men-
tioned, however), the very hidden ones and those that I have recorded
in my notes. Since I see no point in speaking indiscriminately, I have
omitted the stories told by distant disciples and elderly lay people of
the area, who had many special experiences of the Master's powers due
to their faith. These I do not consider reliable, since, as is said:

| Most of the stories of liberation written by disciples
| Exaggerate praise, making the master a charlatan.

Here I have mentioned briefly those happenings related by the Master
himself, those sworn to by close, older disciples, as well as those signs
witnessed publicly by many people.

| Great being,
| Your virtue uproots habitual existence
| And through the absolute, the essential nature of all,
| You have dissolved the very idea of concrete reality
| Into the self-liberated unique state of pure awareness.
| When dualistic thoughts arise like demonic enemy hordes,
| Waging war and trying to obstruct you,
| You expose their true nature-unreal magical constructs.
| All thoughts of arising and ceasing, concepts of past, present, and future, have reached
| The shore of complete equanimity, wisdom beyond time.
| Instantly revealing hidden realities, you follow in the footsteps of the omniscient ones.
| In this life, you easily achieved the excellent signs of attainment
| And the magical gifts so hard to perfect in this world.
| Peerless leader of the teachings and sentient beings,
| How can the imprints of your supreme accomplishments
| Be understood by the limited minds of ordinary people?

Now we will recount how Shakya Shri gained mastery over profound
termas, the gift of discovering extraordinary treasure teachings. The
terma states:

| E ma! I am the Lotus Guru. 251
| I have impressed the profound seal, entrusting
| The deepest quintessence of the master's mind
| Complete with all the instructions that mature and free,
| On the king, his subjects, and vajra kin
| And in particular on Dorje Oiidjom. 252

In accordance with this prophecy, one night when Shakya Shri ar-
rived in the area of the Lapchi mountain, he became absorbed in the
practice of the ultimate meaning. It was then that he first discovered
the terma called The Means to Realize Guru Dewa Chenpo together with its
rite of ripening initiation and liberating instructions. He himself
putthat teaching into practice, obtaining the ordinary and extraordinary
siddhis. Ogyen Rinpoche had prophesized about Shakya Shri:

| In the future, when the most degenerate times have come,
| Dudjom, magical emanation of my mind, will appear,
| He, the great daka, who practices deliberate conduct, 253
| Who is compassionate and realized in the meaning of Dzogchen.
| In the vast expanse of the mind of this daka who bears special signs
| The treasure-teachings will manifest effortlessly;
| When the propitious time has come, he will transcribe them,
| Sealed with a three-year signet of secrecy;
| Gradually disclosing the instructions that ripen and free
| To disciples who have made the right aspirations,
| He will accomplish great benefit for the teachings and for beings.

As in the prophecy, Shakya Shri kept secret the terma he had dis-
covered for three years. Then, for the first time, he gave the initiation
and teaching to a few fortunate disciples. In the course of time, this
method spread and became well-known throughout all regions
of Nepal, China and Tibet.

Besides The Means to Realize Guru Dewa Chenpo, Shakya Shri discov-
ered many other terma teachings rich in profound essential points.
These include, for example, The Three Dimensions if Enlightenment: Reality,
Enjoyment and Emanation; 254 The Peaciful and Wratlful Master; The
Glorious Kilaya; and The Peaciful and Wratlful Manjushri. These extraordinary mind
treasures discovered by Shakya Shri are like massive doud banks of
blessings, profound teachings which effortlessly grant the two accom-
plishments, common and uncommon, to fortunate disciples.

As has been said, Shakya Shri entered Drugu monastery in his
youth. While there he had many visions of Tara, Mahakala and other
deities who performed enlightened actions for his sake and granted
him miraculous powers. Once, when the Master was staying in retreat,
he awoke at dawn, seeing in space before him the face of Guru Tragpo,
union of all Sugathas. Slowly the vision dissolved into the natural state
of his mind. After this experience, he had the pure vision known as
The Mind Accomplishment and transcribed the root text in its entirety.

Thereafter he remained in retreat doing that practice in the
Great Cave of Ewam in Drugu. His perseverance in practice was like
the continuous flow of a river. Day and night he had many visions
of Khamtrul Rinpoche, which increased his faith boundlessly, and inspired
him to compose a prayer of supplication to him.

Shakya Shri remained for another three years in retreat. During
that time he had a dear vision of Mahakala Legden, extremely bril-
liant, vast as the universe. When Shakya Shri experienced a slight fear,
the vision vanished into primordial purity. Later on, he had a vision
of Mahakala Tragshe. Around that time, everything he laid his eyes
on appeared dearly as the color, the ornaments and so forth,
of the radiant body of the wrathful Palbar Maning. 255 Afterwards, he com-
posed a propitiatory rite for that guardian entitled
The Natural Energy of Pure Awareness.

Shakya Shri then lived for a few years at Lhadrag Perna Yang-
dzong. When he stayed at the Long Vajra Cave, Secret Treasury of the
Dakinis, during the day he remained absorbed in contemplation, and
at night he trained in the mind's luminous clarity. Often, at dawn, in
the state of luminous clarity, he would meet lord Milarepa. In those
visions, through signs and in symbolic ways, he received numerous
teachings of the oral lineage. It was on one of these occasions that he
composed a Guru Yoga in the Form of an Invocation to Milarepa, a result of
his pure vision.

In another vision of luminous clarity Shakya Shri met the great
adept Lingchen Repa who conferred on him secret teachings through
symbolic language. At the end of the vision Lingrepa dissolved and
became indivisible &om Shakya Shri's state of pure awareness.
In the second year of his three-year retreat, he composed lfzjra
Laughter as Milarepa with unceasing kindness frequently appeared to
the Master, revealing many teachings during his dreams and experi-
ences of luminous clarity. Responding to a Supplication to the Masters of
the Oral Lineage, Milarepa appeared again to Shakya Shri who, in the
supreme state of luminous clarity, received further teachings in the
form of pure visions &om him. At the end of these visions an old
woman with an orange heard said, "I will request instructions on the
transference of consciousness &om my relative;' 256 and then she van-
ished like a rainbow.

Around that time, at the request of Changtrul of Jori monas-
tery the Master composed parts of The Instruction on the Secret Path of the
Traniference of Consciousness and taught it to the tulku. In each session
of the teaching that Shakya Shri was giving Changtrul, there occurred
many significant signs and omens, such as he pierced an opening in
the tulku's fontanel with a blade of grass.

When the Master was making a pilgrimage to the sacred place
of Khawa Karpo, he spent a day near Kyetrang pass. One night while
sleeping, all the deceptive appearances of thoughts still present during
sleep dissolved into the expanse of reality. In a state of luminous clar-
ity, in that most sacred place, a thigle of rainbow light formed, in the
center of which the Master beheld the single form of Chakrasamvara
surrounded by countless dakas and dakinis. On the basis of this vision
he composed A Supplication to the Single Form of that deity. When
Shakya Shri was staying in the area of Doke pass in Beru, he had a long-lasting
vision of the Medicine Buddha .as one of the' eight brothers' 257 on the rooftop
of a multi-storied house with a checkered design.

Later, as he and his companions were crossing through the pass,
they all saw a spherical rainbow with three rings. At the same time
Shakya Shri saw within that canopy-like rainbow a white daka whose
body was made of light. Above his head was a white standard, and he
wore a lower garment made of five-colored light. His two hands were
holding a drum and a drumstick. He was smiling and joyful:Finally,
the vision dissolved into the expanse of space. Later the Master had
a vision of Black Manjushri, 258 receiving a mind terma, the brief and
profound text, The Means to Accomplish Black Manjushri.

Once when he was on pilgrimage in the region of Tsari at the base of
Chag mountain pass, 259 he stayed atTragkyib cave. 260 One day the
Master took a nap, and in a state of luminous clarity he clearly saw a
sort of monastery with many dark brown windows. In the center
ofthe monastery was the lord of beings, Tsangpa Gyare. His body was
dark brown and he was wearing the three monastic robes, with a medi-
tation hat on his head. His right hand at his heart was in the mudra
of teaching and the left rested on his lap holding a text, in the mudra
of contemplation. He was seated in the lotus posture and was giving
a teaching on the completion phase according to the Chakrasamvara
tantra. He also was making various predictions about the future.
