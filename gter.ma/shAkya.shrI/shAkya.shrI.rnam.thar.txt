A GARLAND OF FLOWERS,
THE STORY OF THE LIBERATION OF THE SUPREME VAJRA HOLDER,
THE VENERABLE MASTER SHAKYA SHRI JNANA

Homage

TOWERING OVER myriad holders of the knowledge of reality,
Skillful in revealing the excellent path, the Vajrayana, [49]
Supreme Vajra Master, bestow on us goodness and excellence!

You are truly Vajradhara in human form, radiant realization ofthe Immutable.
With skillful means and compassion, with hundreds ofmanifestations,
You enter the illusory dimension and save beings extremely difficult to tame.
Teacher Vajradhara who encompasses all space,
At your feet, Lion of the Shakyas, [50] I bow my head in homage.

Powerful speech of the immaculate Victorious Ones,
Pinnacle of all realized dakas, the holders of knowledge,
True manifestation of the glorious heruka, [51]
At your feet, Lotus King, [52] I respectfully pay homage.
To Saraha, [53] Lord of the Realized Ones in Jambudvipa, [54]
And to all masters of Mahamudra and Dzogchen,
The final path of the Secret Mantra, summit of all profound paths, I respectfully bow.

I call to mind the kindness of Kunga Tendzin, 55 and the succession
of masters, sources of the teachings, who have illumined and blessed
the vast Land of Snow with the drumbeat of the glorious teaching of
the Tagpo lineage. [56]

I call to mind the supreme scholar, the accomplished Jamyang
Khyentse Wangpo, 57 mighty voice of infinite buddhas, Manjughosha
(Jamyang) 8 renowned in all the buddhafields, magic manifestation of
unsurpassable wisdom, union of knowledge and compassion (Khyentse)
and lord (Wangpo) of all holders of the teachings.

I call to mind the bodhisattva Kongtrul Lodro Thaye, who through
what is comparable to a fourth compilation of the ocean-like Word
of the Buddha, [59] enacted the enlightened activity of all Tibetan mas-
ters, thus bestowing good fortune on beings that live in this decadent
time. [60]

I bow respectfully to the powerful and accomplished Master
Shakya Shri, who has realized the innate and primordial reality just
as it is, the very nature of all phenomena, the complete sameness of
samsara and nirvana, extracted from the center of the excellent vase
filled with the mind-blessing of sublime lineage masters.
