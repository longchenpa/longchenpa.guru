A GARLAND OF FLOWERS,
THE STORY OF THE LIBERATION OF THE SUPREME VAJRA HOLDER,
THE VENERABLE MASTER SHAKYA SHRI JNANA

Homage

TOWERING OVER myriad holders of the knowledge of reality,
Skillful in revealing the excellent path, the Vajrayana, [49]
Supreme Vajra Master, bestow on us goodness and excellence!

You are truly Vajradhara in human form, radiant realization ofthe Immutable.
With skillful means and compassion, with hundreds ofmanifestations,
You enter the illusory dimension and save beings extremely difficult to tame.
Teacher Vajradhara who encompasses all space,
At your feet, Lion of the Shakyas, [50] I bow my head in homage.

Powerful speech of the immaculate Victorious Ones,
Pinnacle of all realized dakas, the holders of knowledge,
True manifestation of the glorious heruka, [51]
At your feet, Lotus King, [52] I respectfully pay homage.
To Saraha, [53] Lord of the Realized Ones in Jambudvipa, [54]
And to all masters of Mahamudra and Dzogchen,
The final path of the Secret Mantra, summit of all profound paths, I respectfully bow.

I call to mind the kindness of Kunga Tendzin, [55] and the succession
of masters, sources of the teachings, who have illumined and blessed
the vast Land of Snow with the drumbeat of the glorious teaching of
the Tagpo lineage. [56]

I call to mind the supreme scholar, the accomplished Jamyang
Khyentse Wangpo, [57] mighty voice of infinite buddhas, Manjughosha
(Jamyang) [58] renowned in all the buddhafields, magic manifestation of
unsurpassable wisdom, union of knowledge and compassion (Khyentse)
and lord (Wangpo) of all holders of the teachings.

I call to mind the bodhisattva Kongtrul Lodro Thaye, who through
what is comparable to a fourth compilation of the ocean-like Word
of the Buddha, [59] enacted the enlightened activity of all Tibetan mas-
ters, thus bestowing good fortune on beings that live in this decadent
time. [60]

I bow respectfully to the powerful and accomplished Master
Shakya Shri, who has realized the innate and primordial reality just
as it is, the very nature of all phenomena, the complete sameness of
samsara and nirvana, extracted from the center of the excellent vase
filled with the mind-blessing of sublime lineage masters.

He is the one who, at the sunset of the doctrine of the sage of
the Shakya clan, perfectly revealed in a direct way (mngon sum ston pa)
the innate reality, the excellent path that brings benefit to all:
the glorious (dpal pa'i) lord (dbang phyug) of realization, the king
of dharma of the definitive meaning (nges don chos kyi rgyal po). [61]

The scriptures say:

| Those who wish to emulate the master, inspired by their faith
| In his liberation throughout the three times, and in
| His qualities of body, voice and mind,
| Enjoy his wondrous deeds like draughts of ambrosia.

Concerning how to begin a text in the right way,
Dandin in his Mirror of Poetics states: [62]

| Auspicious words of homage
| Are the gateway to any teaching.

Accordingly, having first paid homage to illustrious masters at the
beginning, we now offer the exemplary life of Shakya Shri as the heart
of the book.

In this age of disputes, Shakya Shri stands out, the apex of a
victory banner rippling over an ocean of realized beings, the crown
ornament of millions of masters of the doctrine of the essential
definitive meaning. [63] In his lifetime he appeared as a powerful yogin
who, following the exalted path, had gained the direct realization
ofreality. [64]

In truth, he had already awakened in the primordial ultimate realm
countless aeons ago. However, moved by unlimited compassion, he
continued to care for infinite beings afflicted by suffering whose minds,
unhinged by the demons of both intellective and innate clinging to a sel£ [65]
remained in the prison of samsara, tightly bound by the ropes of
negative karma and the obscuring states of mind. In this age,
worse than the age of degeneration, Shakya Shri unreservedly displayed a
magical charisma through the three secrets (body, voice and mind)
of his embodiment. With his deeds, like a white parasol towering over the
three worlds, [66] he planted the seed of the liberating path in everyone
he met, in accordance with his or her capabilities.

From an early age Shakya Shri Jnana was infUsed with a deep
interest in dharma and manifested a marked disengagement with the
worldly. His outer behavior was that of a king of wandering yogins
who sees all marvels of the world like bubbles of water, devoid
of intrinsic value. Inwardly, he lived in a state of undivided
contemplation by the grace of which, in this lifetime, he ascended
to the highest throne of realization.

Here we shall briefly recount the story of his liberation, embodied
in the three cycles of the life [67] of this great sovereign of
ascetics, indivisible from the primordial buddha.

HIS PREVIOUS LIVES

SHAKYA SHRI LIVED an extraordinary life, and the recounting of it
not only has great meaning, but brings significant benefits as well.
Reading his life story will inspire faith in those who have not had the
fortune to meet him directly, and will increase the devotion of those
who have actually been his disciples, so that their faith will not fade
but remain unswerving.

Accordingly, Chandragomin [68] said:

| These good deeds, the signs of great renown,
| Unveil the path of those gone to bliss, [69] and
| Those lacking in conviction will develop faith;
| Thus, virtuous stories are a source of joy.

The names of the previous incarnations of the Lord of the Mandala [70]
Shakya Shri, whose embodiments as scholar and saint greatly benefited
beings, are as follows:

At one time in this age of wrangling, he was born as the arrowsmith
Brahmin Saraha, [71] who was the forefather of an ocean of realized
beings, an accomplished yogin whose fame still today is widespread in Tibet.

Another time, he was born in India as Mitrayogin, [72] inseparable
in his nature from Garland of Skulls, [73] and a magical emanation of
Avalokiteshvara, [74] the supremely exalted embodiment of the love and
compassion of countless buddhas.

Again he was born in India, this time as the scholar Naropa, [75] protector
of the northern gate of the Vikramashila monastic univer-sity. [76]
Later in Tibet he was born as Rigdzin [77] Dorje Dudjom [78] of
the Nanam family, one of the nine heart-sons or predestined favored
disciples of the second buddha, Padmasambhava.

He was also born as Ngamdzong Bodhiraja [79] the mind-son of
Milarepa who was like the source of a river for the lineage of
attainments, and to whom Milarepa entrusted the lineage of the Oral
Transmission of the Dakinis. [80]

Once he was born as Lingchen Repa, called 'the Saraha of Tibet', for his fame
as a highly realized being reached the plains of the Ganges. [81]

He was the disciple of Drogon Phagmo Trupa, also known as Desheg Khampa Dorgyal. [82]

He was born as Nyagre Sewo, crown of all realized Kagyii masters,
whose real name was Rinchen Gyaltsen. [83]

He was then born as Kunpang Avadhutipa Sherab Gyatso, [84] the master
of Perna Karpo, illuminator of the doctrine of the definitive meaning and holder
of the secret treasury of profound instructions of the attainment lineage
of the glorious Drugpa Kagyii. He was the yogin Amkar Lhenkye Dorje who,
in a single lifetime of practice on the secret path of the dakinis,
the swift and blissful ultimate path, flew to celestial realms in his rainbow body without
leaving physical remains.

He also took birth as the minister Denma Changtra or Denma
Yulgyal Thogo who, armed with bows and arrows, enacted the will
of King Lingje Gesar, 85 subduing the enemies of the doctrine and dark,
demonic forces. According to the needs of his disciples and beings to
be trained, Shakya Shri, like a single moon reflecting in many ponds,
manifested inconceivably infinite emanations both in sequence and
simultaneously.

Shakya Shri's previous incarnations were revealed by indestructible
prophecies of the great master of Oddiyana, Padmasambhava. They
were partly remembered by Shakya Shri himself, and partly indicated
by the two 'gentle saviors', Khyentse Wangpo and Kongtrul Lodro
Thaye, 86 by Drugpa Yongdzin, 87 omniscient in the age of decadence,
and by other authentic masters, as stated in the long life prayers that
they composed for him. To recount the lives of all his previous incar-
nations would take too long; those who wish to learn about them can
read the individual biographies.

| Just as the expanse of reality pervades all space,
| The infinite sunlight of your wisdom
| Illuminates whole continents of countless disciples.
| Your compassion, devoid of the slightest conceptual characteristics,
| Like the eternal full moon, does not abandon the sphere of reality,
| But shines propitiously upon qualified disciples, the ponds which reflect you.
| Nature of all Victorious Ones that fills space with a display of emanations,
| From time without beginning, you have led innumerable beings to the natural state.
| Until there is no samsara, the magical display of your emanations will know no end.

THE EIGHT AUSPICIOUS SYMBOLS OF HIS LIFE

THE LIFE STORY of Shakya Shri is told in eight chapters that correspond to the number
of the eight auspicious symbols:

| His birth, the germination of his aspirations in past lives;
| The blossoming at an early age of his enlightened nature;
| His reliance on accomplished masters for instructions that mature and free the mind;
| His life as a yogin, practicing contemplation in secluded places and realizing innate wisdom;
| His life dedicated to practice, his attainment of blessings and siddhis, such as visions of masters and deities and the discovery of profound termas;
| His altruistic accomplishments and charismatic guidance, benefiting others immensely and illuminating the doctrine, inspiring great masters to shower him with flowers of praise;
| His commitment to the restoration of extraordinary sacred symbols, fallen into ruin, of the Buddha's Body, Speech and
| Mind, and the creation of sacred images through the power of his unbounded, selfless intention;
| His disappearance into the great expanse of reality, having completed his work for the beings of this realm.

CHAPTER I. His Birth: the Germination of His Noble Aspirations in Past Lives

SHAKYA SHRI, THE LORD of yogins, was born in 1853 into the Naru family, in a place of
natural beauty near the sacred site of Lhadrag Perna Yangdzong on the northern border
of Drugu, in the highland pasture called Beru. This locality belonged to the Champa
Lingpa prefecture in the province of Chamdo, the center of the various regions of eastern Tibet.

His father's name was Naru Tonden; his mother, Nyatso Dronma, was a spiritual practitioner
of great purity, blessed with a gentle character. At conception and when the time of
birth was approaching, both parents had auspicious dreams. His mother maintained a pleasing aspect
throughout the pregnancy and gave birth to the child without pain.

Like Ratna Lingpa, Perna Osal Do Ngag Lingpa [88] and other major
tertons, [89] Shakya Shri was born with a long tuft of hair; [90] and his
body was adorned with amazing signs indicating the birth of a special
being. Born in the female Water Ox year, he burgeoned like a bud,
manifesting virtue in both samsara and nirvana, much as is described
in the Life Story of Ratnacbuda:

| As the time of birth approached
| Like rays of nectar in the sky,
| The child who clears away the obscurations of beings
| Was born from his divine mother.

| Among clouds of limitless compassion
| Adorned with hundreds of spokes of the light of virtue,
| His magnificent lithe youthful moon body
| Waxed in the sky of meritorious disciples.

CHAPTER II. The Early Blossoming of His Enlightened Nature
